<p>A new Presentation Tank and Tommy Statue were added to Cedars Park in 2019, complimenting a Centennial Bench and tank plinth. Combined, these make a new War Memorial, at which the community gather each Armistice Day to Remember those who perished in the Great War. Photographs of past services have been compiled <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/7TQfKgET6GWJU8Jv5" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<h3>Representative Tank</h3>

<p>In 1921, the National War Savings Committee donated a tank to Cheshunt, which was placed on a plinth in Cedars Park. This was one of 265 'presentation tanks' (235 '<abbr title="Machine guns only">Females</abbr>' and 30 '<abbr title="Cannons and machine guns">Males</abbr>') given to communities across Britain to acknowledge their financial contributions to the war effort. The Cedars Park tank was 2740, a 'Female' Mark IV, built at Fosters of Lincoln. In May 1940, during a time of need, the tank was sold by Messrs Cox & Danks for 27 pounds, 16 shillings and 10 pence, which supported the Second World War effort. Sadly, most presentation tanks were poorly cared for and ended up in a state of disrepair, subsequently being destroyed (most sold for scrap), the only surviving original being another Female Mark IV located in St George's Square in Ashford, Kent.</p>

<p>2740 was in 'D' Battalion  and first saw Action in the III Battle of Ypres (Passchendaele), supporting 18 Div of the Second Army on 12/8/1917 in the Advance on St. Julien, just NE of Ypres, becoming Ditched due to very soft ground following prolonged heavy rain. On 22/8/1917, 2740 was struck by a German shell, which resulted in it being transferred to the Army Service Corps in early 9/1917 and, after repairs, was converted to a 'Top-Draw Sledge Hauler' (a vehicle designed to pull a supply sledge which carried food, fuel and ammunition to the Front, over the churned-up conditions of war), only retaining its machine gun armament in a defensive role. About a year later, production of its successor - the Mark V - began, and slowly the remaining Mark IVs were taken out of First Line Action and reserved as backup tanks.</p>

<p>In 2004, producers at Pinewood Film Studios commissioned the creation of a replica 'Male' Mark IV tank, named "Frank", which was used for the films <i>The Magic Flute</i>, <i>Wonder Woman</i> and <i>Transformers: The Last Knight</i>. Military vehicle hobbyists Tony Cooke and Kevin Jepson later acquired the tank and carried out an extensive refurbishment. The tank is 13 feet wide and 21 feet long, and weighs around 6&half; tonnes, much less than an original (which weighs around 28 tonnes) thanks to the tracks being constructed of plasticised marine ply, rather than metal. Otherwise, the weaponry and body shell have been accurately replicated. It is slightly shorter than an original, so as to make it easier to move around on film sets.</p>

<p>This tank was briefly placed on the Cedars Park tank plinth on 21/7/2018 to commemorate the Centenary of the Great War Armistice, however it was removed shortly after. At this time, it had the inaccurate markings '4086' and 'A1'. Shortly after, the tracks and Ford Transit engine were removed to be used in the construction of a 'Medium Mark A Whippet' replica. Broxbourne Council purchased the external body for use as a presentation tank in Cedars Park, and in the first half of 2019, the body was painted in <a href="https://www.valsparpaint.co.uk/colours/pre-selected-colours/yellows/wagon-train/" target="_blank">Valspar "Wagon Train"</a>. The tank was brought into the park on 1/7/2019, being placed on the original presentation plinth. Support chocks were later added by Jakant Research. This is the only known replica to be placed on an original tank plinth - after their presentation tanks were removed (most sold for scrap), all other plinths were dismantled or remain bare today. Tony Cooke and Kevin Jepson are now contractors for the tank, carrying out annual repair and restoration works.</p>

<p>"Frank" remembers all who served in the Tank Regiments during the Great War, and an identity has been heavily researched with the help of many experts and museums to be contemporary with the Active Service of the original Cedars Tank. Our replica is based on 2325, a 'Male' Mark IV (machine guns and cannons) of 'G' Battalion of 6th Section (part of HQ Section), 20 Company, listed as the 22nd Battalion Tank (i.e. G 22) - named "Grasshopper" by the Crew. 'G' Battalion fought alongside 'D' Battalion of '2740' on 12/8/1917, and "Frank" was 'Knocked Out of Action' with right track broken. The tank was transferred to 12 Company of 'D' Battalion and in Action on 22/8/1917 'Broke Down and was Ditched'. It does not appear to have returned to 'G' Battalion or even survived, as a "Grasshopper II" existed later in the Battalion. Information about the development of the tank vehicle may be found <a href="great-war-tanks.htm">here</a>.</p>

<p>Recommendations for new signage to be painted onto the tank, in accordance with the original "Grasshopper" tank, have sadly not been approved by the council as at February 2022.</p>

<h3>Tommy Statue</h3>

<p>Cedars Park's excellent bronze sculpture of a Rifleman from the Queen Victoria's Rifle Brigade of the London Regiment - all of eight foot tall - was created by Roger Andrews of Glamorgan, Wales, and donated to the community to Remember all those who were lost in the Great War (it is in special memory of <a href="uglow.htm">Rifleman W.E.T. Uglow</a>). This amounted to some 1 million from the British Empire, with the addition of over 2 million wounded, many of whom succumbed to their injuries or were left permanently disabled. We should also not forget the military personnel and civilians who died while clearing the battlefields, especially in Flanders and the Somme, due to detritus and munitions remaining after the War had concluded.</p>

<h3>Centennial Bench</h3>

<img src="centennial-bench.jpg" style="float: left; margin-right: 1em;" />

<p>A bench was installed in Cedars Park to recognise the centenary of the Great War Armistice. It is made of steel, with imagery of poppies and soldiers walking to war. The bench was produced by <a href="https://www.davidogilvie.com/ww1-seat" target="_blank">David Ogilvie Engineering</a>, and several with this design can be found across the country.</p>

<p>While Cedars Park's Tommy statue is dedicated to all personnel who served in the Great War, it is particularly remembering Rifleman "1687" William Ernest Taylor Uglow, who grew up in Cheshunt and is thought to have been the youngest volunteer recruit from the Broxbourne District during the Great War. He served in 1st/9th Battalion of the Queen Victoria's Rifles, a First Line Territorial Force of the London Regiment, who were part of the initial British Expeditionary Force of 100,000 sent to support France and Belgium against the invasion by the Imperial German Army according to Treaty. Rifleman Uglow joined the Territorial Brigade just prior to the Great War and disembarked in France on 4/11/1914, during the First Battle of Ypres.</p>

<p>In the early hours of 1/1/1915, while sleeping in a barn used as a temporary overnight bivouac, Uglow and over 40 others of his battalion were killed by an incendiary bombardment from Hooge heights - the shell was either from a Trench Mortar or Light Field Artillery. Many others were seriously injured.</p>

<p>W.E.T. was the son of William Ernest and Florence Uglow. He has 'No Known Grave' and is therefore Commemorated on Panel 54 of the Menin Gate Memorial Arch (remembering nearly 55,000) in Ypres (Ieper), Belgium, annotated as a Private. He is also remembered on the Cenotaph at Cheshunt Almshouses. In 2015, he was post-humously given the award of Broxbourne Borough's "Young Citizen of the Year", and a copy of the certificate was placed on his wreath at the Menin Gate.</p>

<p>The statue in Cedars Park is not based on Rifleman Uglow's face, however his uniform includes the buttons of Queen Victoria's Rifles.</p>

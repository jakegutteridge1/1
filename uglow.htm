<P>While Cedars Park's Tommy statue is dedicated to all personnel who
served in the Great War, he was erected to particularly remember
those from the Broxbourne District, and is in special memory of
Rifleman William Ernest Taylor Uglow (1687) who served in the
Queen Victoria's Rifles, and the statue includes the uniform buttons
of this brigade, although it is not based on his face.

<P>Uglow grew up in Cheshunt and was voluntarily recruited as a Rifleman of
1/9th Battalion
(Queen Victoria's Rifles), a First Line Territorial Force of
the London Regiment, who were part of the initial
British Expeditionary Force of 100,000 sent to support France and Belgium
against the invasion by the Imperial German Army according to Treaty.
Rifleman Uglow joined the Territorial Brigade just prior to the Great War
and disembarked in France on 4/11/1914, during the First Battle of Ypres.

<P>In the early hours of 1/1/1915, while sleeping in a barn used as
a temporary overnight bivouac, Uglow and over 40 others of his battalion
were killed by an incendiary bombardment from Hooge heights - the shell
was either from a Trench Mortar or Light Field Artillery. Many others
were seriously injured.

<P>W.E.T. Uglow was the son of William Ernest and Florence Uglow, who lived
at Beaumont View in Cheshunt. He has
'No Known Grave' and is therefore Commemorated on

of the
Menin Gate Memorial Arch (remembering nearly 55,000) in Ypres (Ieper),
Belgium, annotated as a Private. He is also remembered on the

In 2015, he was post-humously given the award
of Broxbourne Borough's "Young Citizen of the Year", and a copy of the
certificate was placed on his wreath at the Menin Gate.

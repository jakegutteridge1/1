In Cedars Park, there is a replica of the Venusberg, a grass mound that
stood at Theobalds Palace. It had a spiral-shaped path and was intended
to provide an elevated view over the estate's gardens. These mounds
were prevalent features of the most
majestic 16th and 17th century properties. There was a small wood
near the original Venusberg, and when the replica was built, many
new trees were planted nearby.

A visitor to Theobalds in 1613 wrote in his diary:

The term "Venusberg" is German, meaning 'Mount of Venus', which is
mentioned in 16th century European folklore, and today associated with
palmistry, being the name of the fatty area near the thumb - a
significant elevation of this area suggests a romantic and sensual person.
The spelling 'Venusburg' on the information boards in the park is believed
to be erroneous.

<P>When this replica was first built, it had real grass and a sandy
gravel path, but in 2018 it was
<A HREF=https://ex.broxbourne.gov.uk/sites/default/files/decision-records/18-110-CedarsParkRefurbishment.pdf TARGET=_blank>completely refurbished</A>
by Broxbourne Council with artificial turf.

<P>As well as overlooking the parkland, many visitors enjoy sliding down
the sides of the mound, although this is not its intended purpose and
should be discouraged as it has caused significant damage.

<P>Due to Cedars Park's aged <A HREF=arboretum.htm>arboretum</A>,
the mound has a limited view during late spring and summer,
the only meaningfully visible area being the adjacent <A HREF=great-garden.htm>Great Garden</A>.

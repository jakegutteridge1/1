In Cedars Park, there is a replica of the Venusberg, a mound that
stood at Theobalds and provided an elevated view over the property
and its gardens. These mounds were prevalent features of the most
majestic 16th and 17th century properties. There was a small wood
near the original Venusberg, and when the replica was built, several
memorial trees were planted nearby.

A visitor to Theobalds in 1613 wrote in his diary:

You come to a small round hill built of earth, with a labyrinth around.<BR>
It is called the Venusberg.<BR>

The term "Venusberg" is German, meaning 'Mount of Venus', which is
mentioned in 16th century European folklore, and today associated with
palmistry, being the name of the fatty area near the thumb - a
significant elevation of this area suggests a romantic and sensual person.
The spelling 'Venusburg' on the information boards in the park is believed
to be erroneous.

<p>The replica mound has a spiral-shaped path. Originally, it had real
grass and sandy gravel, but this has been replaced with artificial turf.
Many visitors enjoy sliding down the sides of the mound, although this
is not its intended purpose and should be discouraged as it has caused
significant damage.

<P>Today, due to the park's aged <A HREF=arboretum.htm>arboretum</A>,
the view that the mound provides is not very good outside of late autumn
and winter, and all that is visible is a portion of the Great Garden,
however it is a nice feature to have as visitors can reflect on how
people used to enjoy Theobalds Palace.

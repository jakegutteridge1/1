<center><h1>Venusberg</h1></center>

<p>In Cedars Park, there is a replica of the Venusberg, a mound that stood at Theobalds and provided an elevated view over the property and its gardens. These mounds were prevalent features of the most majestic 16th and 17th century properties. There was a small wood near the original Venusberg, and when the replica was built, several memorial trees were planted nearby.</p>

<p>A visitor to Theobalds in 1613 wrote in his diary:</p>
<blockquote><i>You come to a small round hill built of earth, with a labyrinth around. It is called the Venusberg.</i></blockquote>

<p>Most websites and documents accept 'Venusberg' to be the accurate historical spelling, however it is spelled as 'Venusburg' on the information boards in the Park. Although these were produced by the Council, their website spells it as 'Venusberg', so the spelling on the park boards may be erroneous. 'Burgh' or 'burg' can mean a hill in some old languages, so this could be the reasoning behind spelling it with a 'u'.</p>

<p>The term Venusberg is German, meaning 'Mount of Venus', which is mentioned in 16th century European folklore, and today associated with palmistry, being the name of the fatty area near the thumb - a significant elevation of this area suggests a romantic and sensual person.</p>

<p>The replica mound has a spiral-shaped path. Originally, it had real grass and sandy gravel, but this has been replaced with artificial turf. Many visitors enjoy sliding down the sides of the mound, although this is not its intended purpose and should be discouraged as it has caused significant damage.</p>

<p>Today, due to the Park's aged Arboretum, the view that the mound provides is not very good outside of late autumn and winter, and all that is visible is a portion of the Great Garden, however it is a nice feature to have as visitors can reflect on how people used to enjoy Theobalds.</p>

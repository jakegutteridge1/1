They are primarily used for farming the pigeons' meat and droppings, however some also harvest eggs and feathers. The droppings make an excellent fertiliser due to their high nitrogen content, and were used in the past to produce gunpowder (as it contains saltpetre), leather softeners and cloth dyes. The feathers are used for pillow stuffing, as there is a myth that those who sleep on pigeon feathers will live a long life. Some people used pigeons for medicinal purposes, as it was believed that they could heal a wide range of illnesses.</p><p>Dovecotes are believed to have originated in Egypt &amp; the Middle East around 2000BC, gaining popularity in the Medieval period. They contain pigeon holes, small niches in walls for pigeons to make their nest. These are often square in shape, but more elaborate designs can be found.</p><h3 style="text-align: center;"><hr /></h3><h3 style="text-align: center;">England</h3><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://bit.ly/3C9om1l" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0" /></p><p>It is believed that dovecotes were first used in England in the Norman period. They were only used by the wealthy. Between October 1412 and September 1413, Lady Alice de Breyne of Acton, Suffolk kept records of all food and drink consumed on her grand property, and on one occasion 'one capon, two chickens and twenty pigeons' were eaten, showing the significance of pigeons in their diet at the time. According to a separate record, the Earl of Warwick held a banquet in 1470, at which 4000 pigeons were reportedly served! Banquets at that time were incredibly grand and a huge number of guests would have attended. Some pigeon farms in the 16th century housed up to 30,000 birds. It was at this point in time that pigeon consumption rose in popularity, beginning to be eaten regularly, rather than occasionally as a delicacy.</p><p>In the 17th century, there were over 26,000 dovecotes in England. There has been a decline in domestic dovecote construction in the country in recent years, with smaller garden birdhouses made of wood replacing the traditional brick building. This is due to a parallel decline in pigeon consumption and developments in fertilisers.</p><h3><hr /><div style="text-align: center;">Scotland</div><div style="text-align: center;"><br /><img src="https://bit.ly/3m9UsEg" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0" /></div><div style="text-align: center;"><p style="text-align: left;"><font size="3" style="font-weight: normal;">Most Scottish pigeon houses are made of stone and they are known as 'doocots'. A 'beehive' shape is common (see picture to right), as well as towers and flat-sided houses with slanted roofs, called 'lectern' doocots. </font><font size="3"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many doocots, especially those in churchyards and religious areas, have crosses, either carved into the building or in the form of a window arrangement. Some had two doors for extra protection of the contents. This was done because poverty </span></font><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: medium;">was high in 18th century Scotland, and food?</span><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: medium;">was more valued than it is today</span></p></div></h3><h3><hr /><div style="text-align: center;">Iran</div><div style="text-align: center;"><br /><img src="https://bit.ly/3B8mOTT" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0" /></div><div style="text-align: center;"><br /><div style="text-align: left;"><font size="3" style="font-weight: normal;">Iranian pigeonkeepers built elaborate towers to accommodate the birds. These are called 'Kaboutarkhaneh'. From travellers' writings, it is believed that a form of pigeon house existed in Iran in the 13th century. However, the majority were built in the 16th and 17th and used a chequered pattern with densely packed niches, and were made of brick with a coating of plaster &amp; lime, or unbaked mud. Gypsum was also used, and a small number contained a wooden skeleton for additional support against the elements.</font></div><div><p style="text-align: start;"><font size="3" style="font-weight: normal;">Pigeons are deeply respected creatures in Islam, symbolising peace and devotion to family, therefore the Iranians did not eat their meat and only kept them for their droppings. The birds were not forcefully captured but were instinctively attracted to the buildings due to the rock-like ledges and crevices resembling those in their natural environment.</font></p><div style="text-align: left;"><div><font size="3" style="font-weight: normal;">The birds were not kept domestically in the traditional sense, in that the tower owners did not provide them with food. They foraged during the day and returned to the towers in the evening. Isfahan was the area most heavily populated with pigeon towers, having around 3000 at its peak in the 17th century. Only around 300 remain standing in Isfahan, and due to recent advances in fertilisers, most are unused and rotting. However, 65 are protected under Iran's National Heritage List.</font></div><div><p><font size="3"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ghada Abdel Monem el Gemaiey of Cairo University observed Iranian pigeon towers and concluded that they consist of three types:</span></font></p></div><div style="text-align: left;"><div style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://bit.ly/3nhdOH4" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0" /></div><div style="text-align: center;"><hr />France</div><div style="text-align: center;"><br /><img src="https://bit.ly/2XFbUY7" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0" /></div><div style="text-align: center;"><div style="text-align: left;"><font><br /><img src="https://bit.ly/3b6IDsc" align="left" style="margin-right: 0.6em;" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0" /><img src="https://bit.ly/2Zik5dm" align="right" style="font-size: medium; font-weight: 400; margin-left: 0.6em;" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0" /><font size="3" style="font-weight: normal;">Early French dovecotes were known as ‘fuies’. Today, the names ‘colombier’ (from ‘columbin’, the Old French word for pigeon) and ‘pigeonnier’ are used, and the word ‘fuie’ refers to a building that has been converted into a dovecote. The French word for pigeon hole is ‘boulin’. Typically, each boulin in a pigeonnier accommodates a pair of pigeons.</font></font></div><div style="text-align: left;"><div></div><p><font size="3" style="font-weight: normal;">Some early pigeon nesting spaces in France were carved into large, unoccupied walls. Some pigeonniers were built from the ground up, while others are raised on a base made of wood, brick or stone.</font></p><p><font size="3" style="font-weight: normal;">French dovecotes were primarily used for harvesting pigeons’ meat, although the droppings were also used as fertiliser (called ‘colombine’). Most were made of brick or stone, and were small in size but had intricate designs. Some churches built in the Medieval Period had large dovecotes on their grounds.</font></p><p><font size="3" style="font-weight: normal;">The Southwest of France has more pigeonniers than any other part of the country, as there are many grain farmers there that do not keep other animals for eating.</font></p><p><font size="3" style="font-weight: normal;">In the Medieval Period, pigeonniers were seen as status symbols and were built on the grand estates of the wealthy to brag that they ate pigeon.</font></p></div></div><div style="text-align: center;"><hr /><font style="font-weight: normal;" size="2">Researched and compiled by <a href="mailto:jake.g@mail.com">Jake Gutteridge</a>, 2021</font></div></div></div></div></div></h3><div></div></body></html>

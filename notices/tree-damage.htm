Trees in Cedars Park have been seen badly damaged on several occasions.
Children can often be witnessed hanging from or sitting on tree branches,
with overlooking parents unaware of the damage that this can cause.

<P>Another cause may be vandalism, however this has only been witnessed
much less frequently.

<P>The above photos show damage that can shorten the life of a healthy
tree. These three photos were all taken within the span of one month!
Exposing parts of a tree trunk increases the risk of disease or
infestation, and is unsightly for other visitors.

<P>Parents, please intervene if you see your child putting force on a
tree branch.

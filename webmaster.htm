<P>Thank you for visiting the Cedars Park website. The intention
for this site is to provide an easy way
for people to find information about Cedars Park, while highlighting
the park's rich <A HREF=history.htm>history</A> as the former site of Theobalds Palace, a
royal residence where significant historical events
have taken place - many people (especially non-local visitors) do
not realise the importance of this parkland.

<P>Tarant Hobbs and Jake Gutteridge (grandfather and grandson)
took over the park website at the turn of 2021/22, creating this new one,
following the shutdown of <I>www.cedarspark.org</I>. Relevant pages from
our personal site "Jakant Research" (covering Cedars Park
and other topics) were swiftly migrated to this address (and expanded),
and other topics separated to a personal site.

<P>Jake is the Webmaster of this site
and has created most of its pages, while Tarant has contributed
heavily to the <A HREF=gwcc.htm>Great War Centennial Corner</A> page,
particularly researching the history of the memorial and tanks in general.
Tarant is eager to contribute to other areas of the website where possible.
We have jointly <A HREF=arboretum/id.htm>tagged the trees</A>
and <A HREF=memorials.htm>listed the memorials</A> around
the park, and both manage the data collected through those projects.

<P>We are passionate about Cedars Park and work
to encourage improvements in the
care and preservation of the park, and bring attention to any failings
in its management, so that it may be continually improved and retain
its status as the premier park in the Broxbourne Borough.

<P>This website is in continual development and any comments
are appreciated by <B>e-mailing us at
<A HREF=mailto:cedarspark@mail.com</A>cedarspark@mail.com</A></B>.
You are also welcome to submit any information, pages or images
to be displayed on the site.

<P>Other subjects are covered at Tarant Hobbs and Jake Gutteridge's
personal website,
<A HREF=https://jakant.neocities.org>Jakant Research</A>.

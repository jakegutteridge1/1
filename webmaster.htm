<P>Thank you for visiting the Cedars Park website, which I took over
at the turn of 2021/22, creating this new one with my grandfather Tarant Hobbs,
who has specifically researched the history of the
<A HREF=gwcc.htm>Great War Centennial Corner</A>.
We have worked together to <A HREF=arboretum/id.htm>tag the trees</A>
and <A HREF=memorials.htm>list the memorials</A> around
the park, and we both manage the data collected through those projects.
We also have a personal website,
<A HREF=https://jakant.neocities.org>Jakant Research</A>.

<P>The intention for this site is to provide a simple way
for people to find information about Cedars Park, while highlighting
the park's rich <A HREF=history.htm>history</A> as the former site of Theobalds Palace, a
royal residence where significant historical events
have taken place. Many people (especially non-local visitors) do
not realise the importance of this parkland.

<P>My grandfather and I both work to encourage improvements in the
care and preservation of the park, and bring attention to any failings
in its management, so that it may be continually improved and retain
its status as the premier park in the Broxbourne Borough.

<P>This website is in continual development and any comments
are appreciated by e-mailing us at
<A HREF=mailto:cedarspark@mail.com</A>cedarspark@mail.com</A>.
You are also welcome to submit any information, pages or images
to be displayed on the site.

<H2>Note</H2>
My grandfather supports me in many ways, and is eager to contribute
to this website where he can, however I have created most
of the pages on this site, and manage it, hence I have only listed
myself as the "Webmaster".

<P>We created our original website <EM>together</EM>,
which was called "Jakant Research" and covered some of Cedars Park plus
other topics,
and when the previous park website (www.cedarspark.org) shut down,
we migrated relevant pages to this address (and expanded them) and
separated other topics to a personal site.

<P><B>This website has always been a <I>joint</I> effort between
both of us, and we continue to improve it together!</B>

<P>Tarant Hobbs and Jake Gutteridge (grandfather and grandson)
took over the park website at the end of 2021, creating this new one,
following the closure of <I>www.cedarspark.org</I>. Prior to this,
we had a personal website (called "<A HREF=https://jakant.neocities.org>Jakant Research</A>",
a fusion of our first names)
which mainly covered Cedars Park, however it was not the main website
for the park.
Relevant pages were migrated to this
address (and expanded), and other topics separated to a personal site.

<P>Jake is the Webmaster of this site
and has created most of its pages, while Tarant has contributed
heavily to the <A HREF=gwcc.htm>Great War Centennial Corner</A> page,
particularly researching the history of the war memorial and tanks in general.
Tarant is eager to contribute to other areas of the website where possible.
We have jointly <A HREF=arboretum/id.htm>tagged the trees</A>
and <A HREF=memorials.htm>listed the memorials</A> around
the park, and both manage the data collected through those projects.

<P>We are active volunteers in Cedars Park and work passionately
to encourage improvements in the care and preservation of the park,
bringing attention to any failings
in its management, so that it may be continually improved and retain
its status as the premier park in the Broxbourne Borough.

<P>We continue to update the website regularly, and would appreciate
any comments by e-mail to <A HREF=mailto:cedarspark@mail.com</A>cedarspark@mail.com</A>.
You are also welcome to submit any information, pages or images
to be displayed on the site.

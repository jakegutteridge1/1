<h1>Cedars Park Covenant</h1>

<p>The Covenant for Cedars Park in Cheshunt, Hertfordshire was published in 1919 when Admiral of the Fleet Sir Hedworth Meux donated the grounds to the people of Cheshunt. The purpose of the Covenant is to outline the way that the Admiral intended the Park to be used by the public, and that it is cared for properly. This document's legality and usability does not expire.</p>

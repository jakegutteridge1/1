<P>The gates at Cedars Park were installed in 2002 to commemorate the Golden Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II's reign. Bronze roundels depict key historical events and figures in the grounds' history. Many public parks <A HREF="https://historicengland.org.uk/images-books/publications/jubilee-ation/jubilee-parks/" TARGET="_BLANK">had features commissioned</A> for this special event, recognised throughout the Empire, however Cedars Park's is perhaps the most significant outside of the Royal Parks, as being the grounds of the former Theobalds Palace &ndash; a much-loved holiday home for Queen Elizabeth I, which later became King James I's favourite estate and hunting grounds, where he 

lived for most of his later life.</P>

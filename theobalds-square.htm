It comprised The Cedars, Old Palace House, Grove House and Jackson House, each of which had their own 'water garden'. <a href="http://jakant.web.fc2.com/flint-arch.htm">A folly arch and two huts</a> were also built as part of this project, although it is unknown if this includes re-purposed materials.</p><hr /><h3 style="text-align: center;">The Cedars</h3><h3 style="text-align: center;"><p style="font-size: medium; font-weight: 400; text-align: start;">The Cedars was built in Yellow London Brick and was the main house on the grounds at the time of their <a href="http://jakant.web.fc2.com/covenant.htm">donation</a> to the people of Cheshunt. It looked over a T-shaped pond that was designed to reflect the <a href="http://jakant.web.fc2.com/flint-arch.htm">Flint Arch</a>. The central structure of this house was destroyed in a fire in the early hours of 18/9/1913 and only the Conservatory (now the new Cafe and a private home) and Billiard Room (now Meeting Room and Toilets) remain.

This is incorrect,, as he died in 1662.</i></p><p>Old Palace House was a gentlemen's villa completed in 1768. A Mr Frederick W Lane lived in the house, although it is unknown when. It stood derelict in Cedars Park for many years until it burnt down in the late 1960s/early 1970s <i>(confirmation of year/date wanted)</i>. The cause of the fire has never been verified, however people have their own interpretations of what it was, whether that be an accident of some sort, arson by thugs, a fire set by the supposed <a href="http://jakant.web.fc2.com/hauntings.htm">ghosts</a> that were living there, or a suspicious fire ignited by the local authority so as to free up space that the abandoned building was taking up sitting there, rotting and empty. Today, a single brick wall stands in Cedars Park, protected by a metal fence. The house's well also stands in the Park, however this has been filled in.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://bit.ly/2VTZmuV" target="_blank"><img src="http://bit.ly/3tU98tE" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0" /></a><a href="http://bit.ly/3ABdoR6" target="_blank"><img src="http://static.wixstatic.com/media/379863_2b8fdfa1a10142e7a2c2ff54320a7e41~mv2.jpg" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0" /></a><a href="http://bit.ly/3hMGc1T" target="_blank"><img src="http://bit.ly/39iNbuL" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0" /></a><a href="http://bit.ly/3lHhZLs" target="_blank"><img src="http://bit.ly/2ZdFnc3" /></a></p><p style="text-align: center;"><font size="2">Photographs extracted from <a href="http://bit.ly/3tSR03c" target="_blank">Zen Mischief</a></font></p><hr /><h3 style="text-align: center;">Grove House</h3><p>A flat block in Churchgate, Cheshunt has been named after this building, and the name of the nearby Theobalds Grove train station may also be.

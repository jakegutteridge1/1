<p>Theobalds Square was a residential block constructed by George Prescott between 1765 and 1770, believed to be utilising materials from buildings at Theobalds Palace that had been destroyed in the Civil War. It comprised The Cedars, Old Palace House, Grove House, Jackson House, and Thornton's House. Each had a 'water garden'. <a href="flint-arch.htm">A folly arch and two huts</a> were also built as part of this project, although it is unknown if this includes re-purposed materials.</p>

<h3>The Cedars</h3>

<p>The Cedars was built in Yellow London Brick and was the main house on the grounds at the time of their <a href="covenant.htm">donation</a> to the people of Cheshunt. It looked over a T-shaped pond that was designed to reflect the Flint Arch. The central structure of this house was destroyed in a fire in the early hours of 18/9/1913 and only the Conservatory (now the new Cafe and a private home) and Billiard Room (now Meeting Room and Toilets) remain.

<p>One of our members (Alec) kindly gave permission to publish a photo of his uncle Bill and his aunty Kath who once lived in Cedars Lodge, the house now behind the cafe. Bill was our park keeper in the late 1950s, and unfortunately, was forced to retire after a brain operation left him paralysed down the left side. Also in the photo are their two dogs called Sam and Snow and a cat called Spiky.</p>

           COUNTRY  HOUSE  DESTROYED
                   BY  FIRE.
                  ___________

            DOGS  GIVE  THE  ALARM.
                     _____

  Early this morning the Cedars, a picturesque
country residence on Theobald's Park estate,
Waltham Cross, owned by Admiral Sir Hedworth
Meux, was entirely destroyed by fire.
  The only occupants were the caretaker and her
son.  The former was aroused by the barking of
dogs, and then she found part of the house in
flames.  She raised an alarm and fire brigades
from the surrounding district were summoned, but
in spite of their efforts the house was burned to
the ground.
  The cause of the outbreak remains a mystery,
but the police are making careful investigations.
This is the second disastrous fire on Sir Hedworth
Meux's estate within a few months, Grove House,
another imposing mansion, having been destroyed
last February.

<h3>Old Palace House</h3>

<p><i>Note: This page previously stated that Major-General William Packer lived at this house. This is incorrect, as he died in 1662.</i></p>

<p>Old Palace House was a gentlemen's villa completed in 1768. A Mr Frederick W Lane lived in the house, although it is unknown when. It stood derelict in Cedars Park for many years until it burnt down in the late 1960s/early 1970s <small><i>(confirmation of year/date wanted)</i></small>. The cause of the fire has never been verified, however people have their own interpretations of what it was, whether that be an accident of some sort, arson by thugs, a fire set by the supposed <a href="hauntings.htm">ghosts</a> that were living there, or a suspicious fire ignited by the local authority so as to free up space that the abandoned building was taking up sitting there, rotting and empty. Today, a single brick wall stands in Cedars Park, protected by a metal fence. The house's well also stands in the Park, however this has been filled in.</p>

<h3>Grove House</h3>

<p>A flat block in Churchgate, Cheshunt has been named after this building, and the name of the nearby Theobalds Grove train station may also be. Grove House burnt down in February 1912.</p>

<h3>Jackson House</h3>

<p>In the 19th century, this building became Jackson School. It was demolished in the early 20th century. Named after Reverend J Oswald Jackson.</p>

<h3>Thornton's House</h3>

<p>Little is known about this building, other than by 1883, it had been demolished.</p>

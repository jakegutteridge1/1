<p>Theobalds Square was a residential block constructed by George Prescott between 1765 and 1770, believed to be utilising materials from palace buildings that had been destroyed in the Civil War. It comprised The Cedars, Old Palace House, Grove House and Jackson House, each of which had their own 'water garden'. <a href="flint-arch.htm">A folly arch and two huts</a> were also built as part of this project, although it is unknown if this includes re-purposed materials.</p>

<h3>The Cedars</h3>

<p>The Cedars was built in Yellow London Brick and was the main house on the grounds at the time of their <a href="covenant.htm">donation</a> to the people of Cheshunt. It looked over a T-shaped pond that was designed to reflect the <a href="flint-arch.htm">Flint Arch</a>. The central structure of this house was destroyed in a fire in the early hours of 18/9/1913 and only the Conservatory (now the new Cafe and a private home) and Billiard Room (now Meeting Room and Toilets) remain.

<h3>Old Palace House</h3>

<p><i>Note: This page previously stated that Major-General William Packer lived at this house. This is incorrect,, as he died in 1662.</i></p>

<p>Old Palace House was a gentlemen's villa completed in 1768. A Mr Frederick W Lane lived in the house, although it is unknown when. It stood derelict in Cedars Park for many years until it burnt down in the late 1960s/early 1970s <small><i>(confirmation of year/date wanted)</i></small>. The cause of the fire has never been verified, however people have their own interpretations of what it was, whether that be an accident of some sort, arson by thugs, a fire set by the supposed <a href="hauntings.htm">ghosts</a> that were living there, or a suspicious fire ignited by the local authority so as to free up space that the abandoned building was taking up sitting there, rotting and empty. Today, a single brick wall stands in Cedars Park, protected by a metal fence. The house's well also stands in the Park, however this has been filled in.</p>

<h3>Grove House</h3>

<p>A flat block in Churchgate, Cheshunt has been named after this building, and the name of the nearby Theobalds Grove train station may also be. Grove House burnt down in February 1912.</p>

<h3>Jackson House</h3>

<p>In the 19th century, this building became Jackson School. It was demolished in the early 20th century. Named after Reverend J Oswald Jackson.</p>

<H1>About This Website</H1>

Several websites for Cedars Park have existed in the past, alongside
<A HREF=https://www.broxbourne.gov.uk/cedarspark TARGET=_blank>Broxbourne Council's page</A>.

<P>This website was created following the closure of
www.cedarspark.org, which lasted 2019 to December 2021. The
content for <I>this</I> site has been researched since 2020
by Tarant Hobbs and Jake Gutteridge, and nothing was taken from
the previous one.

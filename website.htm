<H1>About This Website</H1>

Several websites for Cedars Park have existed in the past, alongside
<A HREF=https://www.broxbourne.gov.uk/cedarspark TARGET=_blank>Broxbourne Council's page</A>.

<P>This website was created following the closure of
www.cedarspark.org, which lasted 2019 to December 2021. The
content for <B>this</B> site has been researched since 2020
by Tarant Hobbs and Jake Gutteridge, and nothing was taken from
the previous park site.

<H1>Copyright</H1>

<P>All content on this site is free to print for personal use,
however if distributing among others we ask that you kindly
add <Q>&copy; Tarant Hobbs and Jake Gutteridge</Q> to the print,
if there is not already a copyright message on the page.

<p>Spanish dovecotes, locally known as 'palomares', are common in the region of Castilla y Leon, as well as Andalusia, Aragon and Extremadura. Unfortunately, many of these buildings are no longer in use and have crumbled.</p>

<p>Old palomares were made of mud or adobe, and are usually circularly or rectangularly shaped. 
Pigeon droppings are called 'palomina' in Spanish, and, like other countries, were primarily used for fertilising crops. Many palomares follow an Oriental style, with a square shape and layered roof, similar to East Asian pagodas. </p>

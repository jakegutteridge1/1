           COUNTRY  HOUSE  DESTROYED
                   BY  FIRE.

            DOGS  GIVE  THE  ALARM.

  Early this morning the Cedars, a picturesque
country residence on Theobald's Park estate,
Waltham Cross, owned by Admiral Sir Hedworth
Meux, was entirely destroyed by fire.
  The only occupants were the caretaker and her
son.  The former was aroused by the barking of
dogs, and then she found part of the house in
flames.  She raised an alarm and fire brigades
from the surrounding district were summoned, but
in spite of their efforts the house was burned to
the ground.
  The cause of the outbreak remains a mystery,
but the police are making careful investigations.
This is the second disastrous fire on Sir Hedworth
Meux's estate within a few months, Grove House,
another imposing mansion, having been destroyed
last February.

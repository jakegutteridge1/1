<p>These networks allow trees as far as 60 feet apart to collaborate, allowing 'mother' trees to feed saplings with carbon, nitrogen and water, as they struggle in the shade beneath high canopies.

<p>While the mother trees feed saplings of all species, they feed rather more to those of the same or a closely-related species. Studies show that pairs of related trees recognise the root tips of their kin, among those of unrelated trees, enabling a kind of arboreal nepotism to thrive.

<H2>"Nepotistic Trees"</H2>
Recent studies show that some trees can nourish each other through
billions of gossamer-like fine-tube hyphae that are created by fungi
around their roots.
<P>These networks allow trees as far as 60 feet apart to collaborate,
allowing 'mother' trees to feed saplings with carbon, nitrogen and water,
as they struggle in the shade beneath high canopies.
<P>While the mother trees feed saplings of all species, they feed rather
more to those of the same or a closely-related species. Studies show that
pairs of related trees recognise the root tips of their kin, among those
of unrelated trees, enabling a kind of arboreal nepotism to thrive.

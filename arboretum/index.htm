The mature and varied Arboretum at Cedars Park includes a plethora
of tree species from around the world, many native English of course
and also many North American. Two notable tree species in the park
are Andean Oak, which is a tree apparently only found in Colombia and
Panama, and it is unheard of for it to be found anywhere else (ours
is a fairly young tree and information & photos in books and websites
gives us strong reason to believe that this identification is correct)
and Crimson King Maple, which is a prize-winning species whose leaves
are a dark purple colour in the summer, then a rich red in the autumn.

<P>The park has several very large London Plane trees. An independent
analysis by some members of the park community found that the London
Planes near the duck pond have an average girth of 6.55 metres, which
a specialist confirmed equals over 400 years of age, meaning that they
were likely planted at a time when royalty were staying at Theobalds
Palace, which stood on the grounds. John Tradescant was Head Gardener
at Hatfield House before the Cecil family moved to Theobalds - it is
believed that it was in Tradescant's garden in Vauxhall that the hybrid
tree which would become known as the London Plane was created.

<P>Two <A HREF=../waltham.htm>Amur Cork Trees</A> were donated to
Waltham Cross and planted in Cedars Park by Waltham, Massachusetts, USA
in the 1930s and in August 1980. These both died and a new one was
planted in recent years, which was unfortunately ring-barked (likely by
muntjacs) in 2019 and died in 2020, despite attempts to repair it using
mud plaster.

<P>To mark the 50th anniversary of the creation of the United Nations,
the Cheshunt Royal Naval Association planted rose bushes and an oak tree
in Cedars Park. This was followed up in 1996 with several trees being
planted in the northwestern area of the park now known as Zone A.
The oak was planted in partnership with Broxbourne Council, who presented
the Cheshunt RNA with a certificate acknowledging that the tree is the
2000th planted by the council since 1987. On 22/4/2004, the Cheshunt RNA
planted a tree near the entrance, to commemorate the 60th Anniversary of
the Battle of the Atlantic.

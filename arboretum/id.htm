Tarant Hobbs and Jake Gutteridge, a grandfather and grandson who are
Friends of Cedars Park, voluntarily identified the tree species in
Cedars Park. The project was proposed to the FOCP (supported by all members) in
July 2019, commenced in August 2019 and completed in Autumn 2021 -
later than expected as the project was delayed by COVID-19 government
restrictions. Jake was 15 years old at the start of the project, the
youngest FOCP member at the time.

<P>Given the fact that some outer parts of Cedars Park are forested,
and that many visitors do not go in these areas, it would be a largely pointless
exercise to identify these trees. Therefore, the park was split into 5
(originally 10) <A HREF=zones.htm>"arboretum zones"</A>, which are also
used in the listing of <A HREF=../memorials.htm>memorial trees and benches</A>.
This arboretum contains over 600 trees.

<P>
<B>Benefits of this project include:</B>
<UL>
<LI>People are able to learn about different tree species, and
local primary schools are encouraged to use materials provided to get
children interested in nature at a young age.
<LI>If people wish to study trees, it makes it easy to find species
that they are looking for.
<LI>Tree work can be carried out more efficiently. Zoning allows contracted
staff who are not familiar with the park to easily locate a particular tree.
<LI>Memorial trees and benches are easier to locate.
</UL>

<P>This may be the only such project that has been completed by just
two people. Tarant and Jake are very confident in the accuracy of these
identifications, as professional books, websites and advice has
been used, including state-of-the-art artificial intelligence
technology approved by National Geographic. Several national bodies, 
including The Woodland Trust and Kew Arboretum, have praised the project,
particularly the quality of the materials produced.

<P>Each identified tree has a unique number, marked on a
circular white tag. <STRONG>Some tags have become warped due to
tree growth and weather, and are currently unreadable. It is
planned to install new pre-printed di-bond discs, which will be a long-term
solution.</STRONG> All discs are fixed with galvanised nails that are safe
to use on trees.

<P>Tree data was originally published in 20p booklets via the park cafe,
but it has since been transferred to this website for free access.

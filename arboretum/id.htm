<H1>Cedars Park Tree Identification Project</H1>
</CENTER>

Identification of the tree species in Cedars Park was voluntarily
carried out by Tarant Hobbs and Jake Gutteridge, two members of the
Friends of Cedars Park, commencing in Summer 2019 and being completed
in Autumn 2021, delayed by the Covid pandemic. These identifications
assist park staff in tree management, as well as visitors in locating
<A HREF=../memorials.htm>tree and bench memorials</A> that have been
planted for late relatives and friends, which have been listed as
part of this project.

<P>All identified trees have a designated number, marked on a
circular white tag. It is worth noting that discs do not always face
a path, and you may need to check around a trunk or on branches. Many
tags have become warped due to tree growth and weather, therefore it
is planned to replace these with permanent pre-printed green di-bond
discs, which will have no detrimental effect on the trees, and will be
a long-term solution. All discs are fixed with galvanised nails.

<P>Originally, trees were listed in booklets (one for each zone) which
were available from the park cafe at a cost of 20p each to support
printing costs, however <A HREF=trees.htm>this list</A> is now free to
read, so that they may be more accessible to the public, and more easily
updated to reflect the latest and most accurate identifications. New
printable identification guides have been produced, containing
<A HREF=leaf.pdf>leaf shapes</A> and <A HREF=bark.pdf>bark textures</A>
for the species identified, as a simple guide to recognising species by
eye, which will help in self-identifying trees that have not been
listed in this project.

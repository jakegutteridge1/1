<p>Identification of the tree species in Cedars Park was voluntarily carried out by Tarant Hobbs and Jake Gutteridge, two members of the Friends of Cedars Park, commencing in Summer 2019 and being completed in Autumn 2021, delayed by the Covid pandemic. These identifications assist park staff in tree management, as well as visitors in locating <a href="../memorials.htm">memorial trees and benches</a> that have been planted for late relatives and friends, which have been listed as part of this project.</p>

<p> All identified trees have a designated number, marked on a circular white tag. It is worth noting that discs do not always face a path, and you may need to check around a trunk or on branches. Many tags have become warped due to tree growth and weather, therefore it is planned to replace these with permanent pre-printed green di-bond discs, which will have no detrimental effect on the trees, and will be a long-term solution. All discs are fixed with galvanised nails.</p>

<p><b>Trees were originally listed in booklets (one for each zone) which were available from the park cafe at a cost of 20p each to support printing costs, however they have now been typed up onto this website, so that they may be more accessible to the public, and more easily updated to reflect the latest and most accurate identifications.</b> New printable <a href="guides.htm">identification guides</a> have been produced, containing leaf shapes and bark textures for the species identified, as a simple guide to recognising species by eye, which will help in self-identifying trees that have not been formally identified.</p>

<h1>Arboretum Zones</h1>

<p>The park has been allocated five zones for identified trees, since many of the trees outside these areas are in large bunches and identifying them would be a large effort with little value. Each zone of Cedars Park's arboretum has its own unique name, reflecting a part of the park's history:</p>

<p><b>A - Deer Park</b> - This area was part of a 2500-acre deer hunting ground built by King James I in 1607 and 1620.</p>

<p><b>B - <a href="great-garden.htm">Great Garden</a></b> - This was a section of a large formal area at Theobalds known as the Great Garden. Sir William Cecil used this garden to host entertainments for Queen Elizabeth I during her visits. It included elaborate flowerbeds, fountains and garden buildings. Bee boles were built into the garden wall, and remain today.</p>

<p><b>C - <a href="theobalds-square.htm">The Cedars</a></b> - A property with this name was built on the grounds in the 1760s. The central building burnt down on 18/9/1913, and today the surviving buildings serve as the cafe, toilets and meeting room.</p>

<p><b>D - Pond Quarter</b> - The duck pond is located in this area.</p>

<p><b>E - <a href="gwcc.htm">Great War Centennial Corner</a></b> - The park's new (2019) War Memorial is located in this area.</p>

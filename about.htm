<h1>About Cedars Park</h1>

<p>Cedars Park is a public park located on <i>Theobalds Lane, Cheshunt, Hertfordshire, EN8 8LS</i>. The grounds once held Theobalds Palace, which was a significant royal estate that most notably accommodated Elizabeth I and James I. This was during a time when England was an absolute monarchy, meaning that the country was run from these very grounds. Therefore, the park is of great historical and national interest.

<p>In 1919, Admiral Sir Hedworth Meux donated the grounds to the people of Cheshunt as a public park, protecting it with a covenant, and the area was opened to the public on 2 July 1921. Over the years, the grounds have been expanded, and they now cover around 19 acres. Today, despite busy dual carriageways on two sides, the park retains a tranquil atmosphere, and many ruins of Theobalds Palace and subsequent structures survive, now serving as charming focal points and a reminder of the Elizabethan, Jacobean and Georgian architectural styles - many of these are Scheduled Ancient Monuments.

<p>Cedars Park is managed by <a href="https://www.broxbourne.gov.uk/cedarspark" target="_blank">Broxbourne Borough Council</a>, with the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/friendsofcedarspark" target="_blank">Friends Group</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/chexs.co.uk" target="_blank">Cheshunt Extended Services</a> organising volunteer activities in the park to support the local community. The council has received funds amounting to some 1.9 million from the Heritage Lottery Fund over recent years, which has been used to add several new features to promote the rich history. The park has received a <a href="https://www.greenflagaward.org" target="_blank">Green Flag Award</a> every year since 2009.

<p>The park is fully wheelchair-accessible, and on-site facilities include toilets, a <a href="https://www.cafesinthepark.com/cedars/" target="_blank">cafe</a>, and an <a href="https://www.cedarsnaturecentre.co.uk" target="_blank">animal centre</a>.

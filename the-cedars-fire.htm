COUNTRY  HOUSE  DESTROYED
BY  FIRE.
<BR />___________
<P>
DOGS  GIVE  THE  ALARM.

Early this morning the Cedars, a picturesque<BR />
country residence on Theobald's Park estate,<BR />
Waltham Cross, owned by Admiral Sir Hedworth<BR />
Meux, was entirely destroyed by fire.
<P>The only occupants were the caretaker and her<BR />
son.  The former was aroused by the barking of<BR />
dogs, and then she found part of the house in<BR />
flames.  She raised an alarm and fire brigades<BR />
from the surrounding district were summoned, but<BR />
in spite of their efforts the house was burned to<BR />
the ground.
<P>The cause of the outbreak remains a mystery,<BR />
but the police are making careful investigations.<BR />
This is the second disastrous fire on Sir Hedworth<BR />
Meux's estate within a few months, Grove House,<BR />
another imposing mansion, having been destroyed<BR />
last February.

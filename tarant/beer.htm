<h1>Museum of Beer and Pub Life</h1>
<b>A Social History Website by Tarant Hobbs</b>
</center>

<hr />

<p>The purpose of this website is to provide an information point where one can find an outline history of the collection of brewing and pub items. This includes phials of malt and hop varieties, hop pockets, brewing and malting equipment and other related items such as heavy horse brasses, barrels, coopering tools, pub signs, pub mirrors, beer bottles from the 1920s, beer engines, brewers' promotional ranges including bar towels. We also hope to provide a pub/brewing photographic and ephemera archive. All of these things were acquired by Tarant Hobbs, who created The World of Brewing Museum, when working for Courage Eastern at the Anchor Brewery, Shad Thames, by Tower Bridge in Southwark. In 1974, whilst a Management Consultant for the company, he began collecting and salvaging the items from closed pubs and breweries before managing the Museum, which was funded by Courage. The World of Brewing opened late 1979. After the brewery was taken over by Hanson Asset Strippers, the museum was sadly closed down in 1980, after only one year of operation. Tarant Hobbs continues to obtain anything of interest about brewing and pubs worldwide. We are always happy to receive anything that should be preserved from these important social industries, with a guarantee that the items will not be sold.</p>

<p><i>This photo was kindly sent in by Burkhart Cording of Hofmark Brewery in Germany. It shows how beer was cooled with snow and ice during and after the Second World War. This photo was on the front of a 1950s postcard from Kloster-Kreuzberg Brewery in Northern Bavaria.</i></p>

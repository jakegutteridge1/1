<i>A very large Cedar of Lebanon, which once stood in the park, and the layout of some the paths, in 1957. Using this scene for comparison, there is not much difference in today's layout. An Atlas Cedar now stands in place of this tree.</i>

<i>Lady Meux with two tigers. Neither She or Henry ever actually hunted or kept tigers. However, Hedworth Meux shot two tigers and a leopard while on a hunting expedition with George V (at the time Prince of Wales), which were stuffed and exhibited in Cedars Park. Unfortunately, one of the tigers was stolen, and the Lowewood Museum (of local history) now holds the animals for preservation and display.</i>

<i>In 1915, some of Admiral Meux's officer friends visited him at Theobalds Park. They travelled there by air balloon, and while landing, the grapple hook ripped down half of a chimney. The chimney still contains visible grooves from this incident. This painting shows what Nielebock thinks it may have looked like.</i>

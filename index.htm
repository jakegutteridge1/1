<h1>Jakant Research</h1>

<hr />

<p>This website covers the independent activities of Tarant Hobbs and Jake Gutteridge. We are a grandfather and grandson based in Essex and Hertfordshire respectively, who are together often and have an interest in researching the history of Cedars Park in Cheshunt, Hertfordshire. We are not a company - the name "Jakant" is simply a fusion of our first names.</p>

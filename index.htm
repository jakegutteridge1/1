<p>Cedars Park is a public park located on Theobalds Lane in Cheshunt, Hertfordshire. The grounds once held Theobalds Palace, which was a significant royal estate that accommodated several royals in its heyday. This was during a time when England was an absolute monarchy, meaning that the country was run from these very grounds. Therefore, the park is of great historical and national interest.</p>

<p>In 1919, Admiral Sir Hedworth Meux donated the grounds to the people of Cheshunt as a public park, protecting it with a covenant, and the area was opened to the public on 2 July 1921. Over the years, the grounds have been expanded, and they now cover around 19 acres. Today, despite busy dual carriageways on two sides, the park retains a tranquil atmosphere, and many ruins of Theobalds Palace and subsequent structures survive, now serving as charming focal points and a reminder of the Elizabethan, Jacobean and Georgian architectural styles. Many of these are Scheduled Ancient Monuments.</p>

<p>Cedars Park is managed by <a href="https://www.broxbourne.gov.uk/cedarspark" target="_blank">Broxbourne Borough Council</a>, with the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/friendsofcedarspark" target="_blank">Friends Group</a> volunteers providing assistance in maintenance and organising public events. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/chexs.co.uk" target="_blank">Cheshunt Extended Services</a> also frequently hold activities in the park to support the local community. The council has received funds amounting to some 1.9 million from the Heritage Lottery Fund over recent years, which has been used to add several new features to promote the rich history. The park has received a <a href="https://www.greenflagaward.org" target="_blank">Green Flag Award</a> every year since 2009.</p>

<p>The park is fully wheelchair-accessible, and on-site facilities include toilets, a <a href="https://www.cafesinthepark.com/cedars/" target="_blank">cafe</a>, and an <a href="https://www.cedarsnaturecentre.co.uk" target="_blank">animal centre</a>.</p>

<p>This community website was independently launched in 2021 (others existed in the past) and is managed by volunteers.</p>

Abundant crocuses and snowdrops recently arrived in their usual annual recurrence, bringing colour to the parkland, which is much-welcomed due to the currently bare trees. Grounds Maintenance also heavily cut some trees and shrubbery, which has greatly tidied up the park's appearance.</p>

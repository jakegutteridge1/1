We undertake projects in the park and are continually researching its history and features. Please note that the main website for Cedars Park is <a href="http://cedarspark.org/" target="_blank">cedarspark.org</a>, and visitors wishing to find information such as opening times &amp; facilities should visit that site.</p><p>Our original website was created in 2020, and its pages were moved to this address in April 2021, where they are continually updated and new pages are added. Most images on this website can be enlarged by clicking on them. In addition to the pages below, video content is available at our <a href="http://bit.ly/jg-ytv" target="_blank">YouTube channel</a>. The name 'Jakant' (pronounced jay-kant) is a fusion of both our first names.

The park is the former site of <a href="http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Theobalds">Theobalds</a>, a significant palace which accommodated Queen Elizabeth I, King James I and several other notable figures. The property was largely demolished during the Civil War, and the grounds were given to the people of Cheshunt in 1919, and opened in 1921 as a public park. Some palace remains still stand in Cedars Park.</p><dl><dt><a href="http://jakant.web.fc2.com/theobalds-timeline.htm">History</a></dt><dd>A complete timeline from 1383 to the present.</dd></dl><dl><dd /><dt><a href="http://jakant.web.fc2.com/gwcc.htm">Great War Centennial Corner</a></dt><dd>War memorial with Representative Tank and Tommy statue.</dd></dl><dl><dt><a href="http://jakant.web.fc2.com/tree-project.htm">Arboretum Identification Project</a></dt><dd>Started summer 2019, completed summer 2021.

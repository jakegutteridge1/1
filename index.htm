<h1>Jakant Research</h1>

<hr />

<p>This website covers the independent activities of Tarant Hobbs and Jake Gutteridge. We are a grandfather and grandson based in Essex and Hertfordshire respectively, who are together often and independently carry out identification and management of trees and memorials in <a href="https://cedarspark.org">Cedars Park</a> in Cheshunt, Hertfordshire, as well as researching the park's history, as the grounds were formerly a significant Royal Palace. Our website also covers other topics that we have researched.</p>

<p>We are not a company - the name "Jakant" is simply a fusion of our first names.</p>

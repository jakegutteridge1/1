<h1>Jakant Research</h1>

<hr />

<p>This website covers the independent activities of Tarant Hobbs and Jake Gutteridge. We are a grandfather and grandson based in Essex and Hertfordshire respectively, who are together often and, since 2019, carry out identification and listing of trees and memorials in <a href="https://cedarspark.org">Cedars Park</a> in Cheshunt, Hertfordshire.</p>
<p>We also research the park's history and features. Once a significant Royal Palace, many people do not realise the grounds' importance in national history. Our website also covers other topics, unrelated to Cedars Park, that we have researched independently.</p>

<p>We are not a company - the name "Jakant" is simply a fusion of our first names.</p>

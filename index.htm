<hr />

<p>This website covers the independent activities of Tarant Hobbs and Jake Gutteridge. We are a grandfather and grandson based in Essex and Hertfordshire respectively, who are together often.</p>

<p>Since 2019, we have carried out identification and listing of trees and memorials in <a href="https://cedarspark.org">Cedars Park</a> in Cheshunt, Hertfordshire. We also research the park's history and features. Once a significant Royal Palace, the grounds are of importance in national history, which many people do not realise. Our website also covers other topics, unrelated to Cedars Park, that we have researched independently.</p>

<p>We are not a company - the name "Jakant" is simply a fusion of our first names.</p>

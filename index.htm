<p>Cedars Park is a public park located on Theobalds Lane in Cheshunt, Hertfordshire. Once the Royal Palace of Theobalds, which was regularly visited by Queen Elizabeth I and later became King James I's favourite residence, the grounds (approximately 19 acres in size) are of significant historical and national interest. England was an absolute monarchy during James I's reign, meaning that for much of the time between 1607 and 1625 - when James I lived here - the country was run right from these grounds. The palace was largely destroyed during the English Civil War, as many of the rooves contained valuable lead, which was sold to support the troops. After acquisition by the Meux brewing family, Admiral Sir Hedworth Meux signed a covenant in 1919 that bestowed the grounds as a public park for the people of Cheshunt to enjoy, which was officially opened on 2 July 1921, named "The Cedars".</p>

<p>Over 100 years after its opening, despite busy dual carriageways on two sides, the park retains a tranquil atmosphere, and many ruins of Theobalds Palace and subsequent structures survive, now serving as charming focal points, as well as a reminder of the Elizabethan, Jacobean and Georgian architectural styles.</p>

<p>Cedars Park is managed by Broxbourne Borough Council, with the Friends Group volunteers providing assistance in maintenance and organising public events. The council has received funds amounting to some 1.9 million from the Heritage Lottery Fund over recent years, which has been used to add several new features to promote the rich history. The park has received a <a href="https://www.greenflagaward.org" target="_blank">Green Flag Award</a> every year since 2009.</p>

<p>This independent community website was launched in 2021 (others existed in the past) and is managed by volunteers independent of the Council or Friends Group.</p>

Abundant crocuses and snowdrops recently arrived in their usual annual recurrence, bringing colour to the parkland, which is much-welcomed due to the currently bare trees. Grounds Maintenance also heavily cut some trees and shrubbery, which has greatly tidied up the park's appearance.

<h1 style="text-align: center;">Welcome to Jakant Research</h1><p>
</p><hr />This website covers the independent activities of Tarant Hobbs and Jake Gutteridge. We are regular visitors (since 2006) to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cedars_Park,_Cheshunt" target="_blank">Cedars Park</a>
in Cheshunt, and carry out projects in the park and are continually
researching its history and features to be displayed on this site.
Please note that the main website for Cedars Park is <a href="https://cedarspark.org" target="_blank">cedarspark.org</a>, and visitors wishing to find information such as opening times &amp; facilities should visit that site.<br />

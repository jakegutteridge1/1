<P> The bodies of the wife of a nursery worker,

previous day, were found to-day in a lake in
Cedar's Park, Waltham Cross.

An inquest on a mother and child was
held at Cheshunt, the woman being Ada
Jordan, of Waltham Cross, and her son
Jack, aged five. The bodies were found in
an ornamental lake in Cedars Park, Waltham Cross.

<P>The husband said Mrs. Jordan has suffered
from acute pains in the head. When
out for a walk recently they passed the
lake, and his wife said: "There is enough
water there to drown anyone." The morning
after their disappearance he remembered this,
and on going to the park he saw the bodies.
The boy was delicate and the
mother feared he would never be strong
enough to earn his own living. The jury returned
a verdict that the mother murdered her son
and then committed suicide while of unsound mind.

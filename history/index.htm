<p>The grounds that are now Cedars Park have a rich and significant history, as they (and the immediate vicinity) once held Theobalds Palace, which was used by several royals. Cedars Park is one of a few areas in Cheshunt and Waltham Cross where intact remains of this palace can be found.</p>

<p>Numerous websites and articles have been referred to in order to provide a thorough historical report. These have not been noted in the process, so it would be very difficult to go through and reference each piece of information with its respective research source. We therefore thank all of those who have published information on Theobalds Palace.</p>

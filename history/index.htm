<p>This section of the website is dedicated to Theobalds, a significant property which stood on the grounds now known as Cedars Park (as well as the immediate vicinity). Cedars Park is one of a few areas in Cheshunt and Waltham Cross where intact remains of the palace can be found. We hope to create a comprehensive historical report of the events that occurred on these grounds, and the buildings that stood on them, starting from the earliest known building to the current public park, so that the rich history can be showcased and preserved.</p>

<p>Dates are in Day/Month/Year format. Additions and corrections are welcomed at <a href="mailto:cedarspark@mail.com">cedarspark@mail.com</a>.</p>

<p>Numerous websites and articles have been referred to in order to provide a thorough and accurate historical report. These have not been noted in the process, so it would be very difficult to go through and reference each piece of information with its respective research source. We therefore thank all of those who have published information on Theobalds Palace.</p>

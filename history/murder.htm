           ===================
          MAD  MOTHER'S  CRIME.
                  _____

  An inquest on a mother and child was
held at Cheshunt, the woman being Ada
Jordan, of Waltham Cross, and her son
Jack, aged five.  The bodies were found in
an ornamental lake in Cedars Park, Wal-
tham Cross.
  The husband said Mrs. Jordan has suf-
fered from acute pains in the head.  When
out for a walk recently they passed the
lake, and his wife said: "There is enough
water there to drown anyone."  The morn-
ing after their disappearance he remem-
bered this, and on going to the park he saw
the bodies.  The boy was delicate and the
mother feared he would never be strong
enough to earn his own living.
  The jury returned a verdict that the
mother murdered her son and then com-
mitted suicide while of unsound mind.

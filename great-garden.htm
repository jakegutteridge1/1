The fountain in the middle-most knot stood upon three stone steps and incorporated waterspouts in a number of concealed pipes which sprayed unsuspecting passers-by. The Great Garden also had three gravel walks, divided by thorn hedges interplanted with sycamore, lime and elm trees and a variety of fruit trees apple, pear, plus[sic] and cherry. Other features included a Banqueting House, a carved timber pergola and an obelisk and sundial made of alabaster. The Great Garden’s formal layout was designed to be viewed from the roof walks and a canal enabled visitors to pass through the garden by boat.</i></p><p>- <a href="http://bit.ly/3wRsDVn" target="_blank">&quot;Theobalds: An Elizabethan Prodigy House&quot; (Tudor Times)</a> <font size="2">- extracted 12/11/2021</font></p><p>(<a href="http://bit.ly/3De2lPi" target="_blank">Another source</a> states that the knot gardens were 1 hectare in size.)</p></blockquote><p>One walled section (likely one of the knot gardens) remains in Cedars Park today and serves as a field for all purposes, often used for picnics, sports, and events.</p><p>The wall of the garden contains several bee boles - these are small niches designed to hold skeps, which are a type of man-made beehive. Skeps are believed to have originated in Ireland around 500, and their purpose is to shelter bees from rain, as the optimal conditions of a dry and warm climate inside the beehive can result in higher-quality honey being produced. Harvested honey would have likely been served to the Queen.</p><p>The wall, and its bee boles (although not in use), are mostly still standing in Cedars Park today, but the structure is crumbling and a portion has completely collapsed, despite the wall being treated with soft lime mortar in recent years to protect it from weather damage.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://bit.ly/3uc5Ulw" target="_blank"><img src="https://bit.ly/3uc5pIa" /></a></p></body></html>

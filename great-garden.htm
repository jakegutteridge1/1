The Great Garden at Theobalds was an arrangement of formal gardens
where Sir William Cecil entertained Queen Elizabeth I with elaborate events.

<I>A description from 1598 refers to its nine knot gardens, 70 feet square*,
each with a white marble fountain in the middle. The fountain in the
middle-most knot stood upon three stone steps and incorporated waterspouts
in a number of concealed pipes which sprayed unsuspecting passers-by.
The Great Garden also had three gravel walks, divided by thorn hedges
interplanted with sycamore, lime and elm trees and a variety of fruit trees
apple, pear, plus[sic] and cherry. Other features included a
Banqueting House, a carved timber pergola and an obelisk and sundial made of
alabaster. The Great Garden's formal layout was designed to be viewed from
the roof walks and a canal enabled visitors to pass through the garden by boat.</I>

<P>A walled knot garden remains in Cedars Park
today and serves as a field for all purposes, often used for picnics,
sports, and public events.

<P>The wall is made of Tudor red brick, and contains
several bee boles - small niches designed to hold skeps, a
type of man-made beehive. Skeps are believed to have originated in Ireland
around 500 AD, and their purpose is to shelter bees from rain, as the
optimal conditions of a dry and warm climate inside a beehive can improve
the quality and quantity of honey being produced. Harvested honey would
have likely been served to Elizabeth I on her stays at Theobalds.

<P>The wall, and its bee boles (although not in use today), are mostly
still standing in Cedars Park today, but the structure is crumbling and
a portion has completely collapsed, despite the wall being treated with
soft lime mortar in recent years to protect it from weather damage.

<P>It is probable that this is one of the only sites in the world where
<EM>royal</EM> bee boles still stand.

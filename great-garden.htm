<center><h1>Great Garden</h1></center>

<p>The Great Garden at Theobalds was an arrangement of formal gardens where Sir William Cecil entertained Queen Elizabeth I with elaborate events.</p>

<blockquote>
<i><p>A description from 1598 refers to its nine knot gardens, 70 feet square*, each with a white marble fountain in the middle. The fountain in the middle-most knot stood upon three stone steps and incorporated waterspouts in a number of concealed pipes which sprayed unsuspecting passers-by. The Great Garden also had three gravel walks, divided by thorn hedges interplanted with sycamore, lime and elm trees and a variety of fruit trees apple, pear, plus[sic] and cherry. Other features included a Banqueting House, a carved timber pergola and an obelisk and sundial made of alabaster. The Great Garden's formal layout was designed to be viewed from the roof walks and a canal enabled visitors to pass through the garden by boat.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>(*<a href="https://www.gardenvisit.com/gardens/theobalds_park" target="_blank">Another source</a> states that the knot gardens were 1 square hectare in size.)</p>

<p>One walled section (one of the knot gardens) remains in Cedars Park today and serves as a field for all purposes, often used for picnics, sports, and public events.</p>

<p>The wall of the garden is made of Tudor red brick, and contains several bee boles - these are small niches designed to hold skeps, a type of man-made beehive. Skeps are believed to have originated in Ireland around 500, and their purpose is to shelter bees from rain, as the optimal conditions of a dry and warm climate inside the beehive can improve the quality and quantity of honey being produced. Harvested honey would have likely been served to Elizabeth I on her stays at Theobalds.</p>

<p>The wall, and its bee boles (although not in use today), are mostly still standing in Cedars Park today, but the structure is crumbling and a portion has completely collapsed, despite the wall being treated with soft lime mortar in recent years to protect it from weather damage.</p>

<p>It is probable that this is one of the only sites in the world where royal bee boles still stand.</p>

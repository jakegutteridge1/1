These were added by local charity Vision4Growth (now <a href="https://bit.ly/39iUh2f" target="_blank">BlindActive</a>) and are named &quot;17th Century Disability Gardens&quot; - they may be imitating the style of 17th-century flowerbeds, or perhaps it was at that time that sensory gardens began being planted. Sensory gardens contain scented plants and their purpose is to provide enjoyment of the plants to blind people, while also being aesthetically attractive for sighted people. The beds are re-planted annually, and recurring plants include lavender, mint and lemon-balm.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://bit.ly/3nQgOw6" target="_blank"><img src="https://bit.ly/3hQ1MlZ" align="middle" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0" /></a></p></body></html>

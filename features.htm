<p>Many ruins of Theobalds Palace and subsequent constructions can be found around Cedars Park, and while these were once homes or outbuildings, they now serve as charming focal points for the park, as well as a reminder of the Elizabethan, Jacobean and Georgian architectural styles. Some of the features listed were added in the 2010s after Broxbourne Council received a grant of &pound;1.89 million from the Heritage Lottery Fund.</p>

<p>A Google Earth aerial map of the park's features has been created as a community project, and may be viewed <a href="https://bit.ly/30O1y9S" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<H1>Cedars Park Ghost Stories</H1>
</CENTER>

Throughout the 18th century, there were several occasions on which
a  young and pretty lady dressed in silk was seen staring out of a
window in Admiral Meux's private house, appearing to wait for
someone who never came.

<P>While this spooked people in itself, there were further occasions
on which an older lady, described to be very scary in appearance, was
spotted on Meux's house grounds.

<P>Other accounts of sightings on the park grounds describe
<A HREF=theobalds-square.htm>Old Palace House</A> at the North of the
park being haunted by several ghosts, although detailed records of
these claims have been lost and the descriptions and how many
are not known.

<P>In the early 1960s, <A HREF=https://zenmischief.com/2009/06/ghost-stories/ TARGET-=-_blank>
a group of teenage friends entered Old Palace House</A>, exploring the
then dank and derelict building, bringing their small Terrier with them.
When they tried to walk up the staircase, the dog refused and was
terrified of something that she saw at the top, <I>shaking like a leaf</I>.

<P>Old Palace House burnt down a few years after. Only a single brick
wall remains, which is on display in Cedars Park, and it is believed
that any supposed ghosts that have been spotted there in the past have
since vanished.

<P>A long-time visitor of Cedars Park shared this story on the <A HREF=https://cedarspark.proboards.com/thread/5/flint-stone-huts TARGET=_blank>park forum</A>:

<I>Do you remember being able to play and climb on the old <A HREF=flint-arch.htm>flint huts</A>
in Cedars Park? The huts are still there today of course, but now have iron
railings around them to protect them. I can recall the ghost story that
my elder sisters told me when I was a small child while we were sitting
cross legged on the floor in the second hut.
<P>She said that during WWII, home guard soldiers were made to camp in
these huts in case the Germans parachuted into the park at night. It was
while they were sitting around a small fire in the middle of a hut that
they began (obviously at midnight), to hear the sound of a crying woman
and baby. Night after night at the stroke of midnight they would hear the
same thing. One night, one of the soldiers plucked up the courage to follow
the sound. He the led to the swamp (pond) where he saw the ghost of a young
mother and her baby standing and sinking into the swamp. Evidently, she had
given birth to a baby out of wedlock and could no longer stand be shunned
by her neighbours and so had walked into the swamp to kill herself and her
child. Well, to a five year old, that was some scary shit!</I>

We now understand that this is likely a reference to a
<A HREF=murder.htm>murder</A> that occurred in February 1924, although the
story may have been changed in the ghost story.

When they tried to walk up the staircase, the dog refused and was terrified of something that she saw at the top, supposedly 'shaking like a leaf'.</p><p>Old Palace House burnt down a few years after - only a single brick wall remains, which is on display in Cedars Park, and it is believed that any supposed ghosts that have been spotted there in the past have since vanished.</p><p>A member of the local community shared this story:</p><p><i>' Do you remember being able to play and climb on the old flint huts in Cedars Park? The huts are still there today of course, but now have iron railings around them to protect them. I can recall the ghost story that my elder sisters told me when I was a small child while we were sitting cross legged on the floor in the second hut.</i></p><p><i>She said that during WWII, home guard soldiers were made to camp in these huts in case the Germans parachuted into the park at night. It was while they were sitting around a small fire in the middle of a hut that they began (obviously at midnight), to hear the sound of a crying woman and baby. Night after night at the stroke of midnight they would hear the same thing. One night, one of the soldiers plucked up the courage to follow the sound. He the led to the swamp (pond) where he saw the ghost of a young mother and her baby standing and sinking into the swamp. Evidently, she had given birth to a baby out of wedlock and could no longer stand be shunned by her neighbours and so had walked into the swamp to kill herself and her child. Well, to a five year old, that was some scary shit!

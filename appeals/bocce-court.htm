The bocce court in Cedars Park was added when the Park was being
re-developed with the Heritage Lottery fund, and a fence was never
installed. There is only a low-rise wooden border. This means that
children frequently walk onto the court and disturb the surface,
often leaving marks on it with their bicycles and scooters, and
sometimes even digging it up. This leaves it in poor condition for
playing. The Council have been asked to install a fence to protect the court,
but they stubbornly refuse to do so, even though community funds
could be found to cover costs. The surround timbers, especially on the
southern end, are rotting away, as softwood was used - this urgently
needs replacing.

<P>We are trying to raise awareness and funds for a simple fence to be built
around the bocce court. The court surface is also in poor condition
and should be replaced - regular Italian bocce players claim the council
promised to replace the surface, however to date (18/6/2022 - months after)
this has not been done! There are many bocce groups in Hertfordshire and
they are unable to be invited to play on this court due to its poor
standard of maintenance. Additionally, the pergola should have a roof
for players to be able to take shelter when there is rain, and a
section of the roof has been broken for two years and needs repairing.
A small table should also be added for players' recreation purposes.

<P>If you are interested in helping to get these improvements done, by
donating or adding supportive comments, <B>please contact us at

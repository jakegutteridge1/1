<H1>The problem with Cedars Park's palace model plinths</H1>
</CENTER>

<HR>




The excellent plinths with models of Theobalds Palace were added
to Cedars Park as part of the
Heritage Lottery Fund improvements to the park. It is great to have
these plinths in the park, and they depict different areas of the
palace with information plaques, which include Braille, however the plinths were
poorly designed, and some of the concrete supports are now in a
concerning condition. Please watch the videos for more information.

<P><B>Please e-mail <A HREF=mailto:cedarspark@mail.com>cedarspark@mail.com</A></B>
if you agree that Broxbourne Council should add PMMA sheeting on top
of all model plinths in Cedars Park, so that water and detritus do
not collect, and if you agree that some of the concrete supports should
be replaced or filled.

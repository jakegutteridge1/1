Litter is only really an issue in Cedars Park during the summer months,
when large numbers of people bring picnics and leave their rubbish once
they have finished. Additionally, the many people disposing of rubbish
properly cause the park's bins to overflow, and they are not emptied
frequently enough by Broxbourne Council's staff.

<P>The Council should instruct
<ABBR TITLE="Broxbourne Environmental Services Trading">Best</ABBR>
staff to empty bins more frequently during the months of June,
July and August, and on hotter days in other parts of the year, for
example when the temperature is 25&deg;C or above, as this is when
people come to the park in droves.

<P>Additionally, to deter litterers, signage should be added
around the park to remind people of the £100 fine for littering
within the Broxbourne Borough. Waltham Cross town centre even
includes warnings of a £2,500 fine! CCTV (or dummy) cameras should
also be installed around the park to deter litterers, and this
will also help to keep vandalism down - this can even be operated
by independent members of the community, to relieve the council of
this additional work. 

<P><B>Please send any comments to
<A HREF=mailto:cedarspark@mail.com>cedarspark@mail.com</A></B> if you
agree with this suggestion.

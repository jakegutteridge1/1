We have observed continual failings in the management of Cedars Park and are
concerned that
Broxbourne Borough Council have failed to pay attention to, and provide
sufficient action on, several ongoing issues in the park. Please watch
the video to understand some of these problems.

<P><B>Please e-mail us at <A HREF=mailto:cedarspark@mail.com>cedarspark@mail.com</A></B>
to show your agreement in the opinion that
the council are managing Cedars Park with shortcomings, and that
significant improvement is essential.

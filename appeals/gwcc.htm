The <A HREF=../gwcc.htm>Great War Centennial Corner</A> war memorial in Cedars Park can
often be seen in a damaged or dirty state.
Tony Cooke and Kevin Jepson are contracted to maintain the tank,
however they only visit periodically (from outside the borough)
and Broxbourne Borough Council provide insufficient attention to ensure
it is properly cared for. Please watch the video to understand
the concerns raised.

<P>In addition to this, it has been recommended to the council that
CCTV (or at least a dummy) is installed at this war memorial. This
is due to the fact that local schoolchildren have been seen
climbing over the protective fencing to walk
up the tank and sit at the top. This has caused
significant damage to the tracks. If vandals are caught on camera,
they can be made to pay the repair fees, and a camera on display
would generally deter people from entering the tank enclosure.

<P>It should be noted that Broxbourne Borough Council are not
interested in the military or even remembrance aspect of this war
memorial. It has even been claimed that the Chief Executive Jeff Stack
has said that it is not a war memorial, despite presentation tanks and
Tommy statues being intended for remembrance purposes! We think you
will agree that some of the plans for the memorial that we have heard
discussed (mentioned in video) are quite shocking.

<P><B>Please write comments by e-mail to
<A HREF=mailto:cedarspark@mail.com>cedarspark@mail.com</A>, or contact
Broxbourne Council's
<A HREF=mailto:jeff.stack@broxbourne.gov.uk>Chief Executive Officer</A></B>,
voicing your views on this subject. They should be treating this fantastic
war memorial with great pride and care, instead of neglecting it!

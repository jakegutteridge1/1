<H1>Neglect of the Venusberg Mound</H1>
</CENTER>

<HR>

The <A HREF=../venusberg.htm>Venusberg mound</A> in Cedars Park
is currently in very poor
condition. The artificial turf surface, added in 2018,
has become loose in parts since around 2020, due to a large
number of children sliding down the sides, which is not the intended
purpose of the mound. Several loose pieces have been pulled off
by children, and possibly also vandals. Parts of the artificial turf have been
moved to other parts of the park on at least two occasions. It is
important that parents watch
children while they are playing on the mound, as they may
playfully pull on the turf without realising the consequences.

<P>Since the first damage appeared around 2020,
Broxbourne Council have had parts repaired, however many
have been damaged again and not dealt with. Additionally,
the repaired areas are clearly patched and spoil the look
of the mound (this is not the Council's fault).
The separation of the turf from the mound may be down to
how it was installed - when repairs were being made, it was noted
that the people
installing the turf (believed to be an external company)
were applying adhesive sparingly using dots, where it would
have been more appropriate and effective to apply it
generously in a zig-zag pattern, to ensure a strong and
long-lasting hold.

<P>It is important that Broxbourne Council have the Venusberg mound
swiftly and properly repaired whenever it is damaged, and that they ensure
that adhesive is added in an effective manner that will ensure
the longevity of each newly-installed piece of turf. <B>Please e-mail

<H1>Neglect of Cedars Park Heritage Walls</H1>
</CENTER>

<HR>

Cedars Park is the former site of Theobalds Palace, and several
aged walls, some of which are Scheduled Monuments, remain in the
park today. Some of these were given preservative treatment using
funds from the
Heritage Lottery and English Heritage in the first half of the
2010s, however today a large number of the walls
have undergone severe damage - one segment of a wall even collapsed
in 2019(?) and has not yet been reconstructed, and other structures
are crumbling and likely also at risk of collapse. <STRONG>Weed control in
walls is also very poor</STRONG>, which may contribute to faster
structural deterioration. It may only be
a matter of time before someone is seriously injured.
These walls were previously listed on English Heritage's
"At Risk" register, however they were removed  from this register for
an unexplained reason - they
are clearly at risk, evidenced by collapsing.

<P>The structures in Cedars Park are a part of Hertfordshire's history,
as well as of <STRONG>national</STRONG> importance, and it would be a
tragedy and a disgrace to see all of these walls eventually disappear.

to show your support in getting the council to do the obvious right thing
and take the appropriate measures to have our historic walls properly preserved.

<TD>Note the overgrown weeds. Several small trees even grew from seeds
that had fallen from above (which were cut down late 2021) - a sign of how
long the wall has been left unrepaired! A sticker
reads 'Robyland Ltd', a construction company.
We appreciate that COVID-19 may have caused delays in 2020, however
there is no excuse for the wall still being unrepaired in 2022!

<TD>Bricks have fallen out or been removed. These holes should
be filled or the bricks replaced.

<TD>Large chunk of wall missing. Other bricks may fall out or be
pulled out and this part of the wall could become more prone to collapse.

<TD>Wall on Theobalds Lane. Looking from outside the park
(the other side is the Woodland Walk forest, where weed control is difficult).
Mysterious missing part at top
is unsightly and should be repaired with replacement bricks.

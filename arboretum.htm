<center><h1>Cedars Park Arboretum</h1></center>

<p>Our varied and aged Arboretum includes a plethora of tree species from around the world, many native British of course and also many North American. A list of <a href="tree-fun-facts.htm">tree fun facts</a> has been compiled, mainly pertaining to the different species found at Cedars Park. Two notable tree species in Cedars Park are Andean Oak, which is a tree apparently only found in Colombia and Panama, and it is unheard of for it to be found anywhere else - ours is a fairly young tree and information & photos in books and websites gives us strong reason to believe that this identification is correct - and Crimson King Maple, which is a prize-winning species whose leaves are a dark purple colour in the summer, then a rich red in the autumn.</p>

<p>The Park has several very large London Plane trees. An independent analysis by some members of the Park community found that the London Planes near the duck pond have an average girth of 6.55 metres, which a specialist confirmed equals over 400 years of age, meaning that they were likely planted at a time when Royalty were staying at Theobalds Palace, which stood on the grounds. John Tradescant was Head Gardener at Hatfield House before the Cecil family moved to Theobalds - it is believed that it was in Tradescant's garden in Vauxhall that the hybrid tree which would become known as the London Plane was created.</p>

<p>Two Amur Cork Trees were donated to Waltham Cross and planted in Cedars Park by Waltham, Massachusetts, USA in the 1930s and 1980s. These both died and a new one was planted in recent years - this tree was ring-barked in 2019 and died in 2020. More information on this subject can be found <a href="waltham.htm">here</a>.</p>

<h3>Identification Project</h3>

<p>A major project commenced 2019 with the aim of identifying all of the trees in Cedars Park. This is in response to seeing visitors' curiosity about different species in the park, as well as to assist relatives with finding memorial trees and the park staff with carrying out general tree maintenance works. Areas of dense tree population have not been identified, as we feel that this is too large a challenge to take on and of little benefit to the community.</p>

<p>To make identification easier, Cedars Park has been split into zones A to E (illustrated below). All identified trees have a designated number, marked on a white disc. We understand that some of these discs have become warped due to weather and tree growth, therefore they may be soon replaced with stronger di-bond discs, which will have no detrimental effect on the trees.</p>

<p>Species identification was mostly completed early September 2021, with a small number of trees having to be identified in 2022 due to leaves falling off in the autumn. The project would have been completed sooner if we had not been hindered by the Covid Pandemic.</p>

<p>Species Identification Booklets are available in the Park Cafe for 20p to cover printing costs - please request these from the staff. These booklets are currently zonal, as they have been since the start of the project, however we are in the process of compiling them into a single, larger booklet. Also, a list of tree species by total number in the park can be found <a href="cedars-tree-species.txt">here</a>.</p>

<p>We are not responsible for any poisoning as a result of our tree identifications. While research has been carried out to a very high standard and is likely to be accurate, errors are of course possible. Therefore, please do not eat any plants marked as edible fruits without also doing your own checks.</p>

<p>In conjunction with this project, the personal memorials have been listed. These are trees and benches that have been planted or plaqued in memory of a late relative or friend. Presently, our list only includes the memorials located within the main zones of the park. The list can be viewed here and we would be grateful for any information about missing names, to our e-mail address, <a href="mailto:jakant@mail.com">jakant@mail.com</a>.</p>

<p>Each zone has its own unique name, reflecting a piece of the park's history:</p>

<p><b>A - Deer Park</b> - In 1607 and 1620, James I expanded Theobalds to create a 2500-acre deer hunting ground, which was enclosed by a ten mile long brick wall. H unting was a favourite pastime of the Royals at the time.</p>

<p><b>B - Great Garden</b> - This was Sir William Cecil's garden that he designed for Queen Elizabeth I, with elaborate flowerbeds, fountains and garden buildings, as well as bee boles in the garden wall. The Queen is thought to have held several social gatherings at this venue, organised by Cecil.</p>

<p><b>C - The Cedars</b> - Original name of the park, and a <a href="theobalds-square.htm">property</a> that stood on the grounds (whose smaller buildings are now the cafe & meeting room/toilet blocks - the central building was destroyed).</p>

<p><b>D - Pond Quarter</b> - The duck pond is located in this area.</p>

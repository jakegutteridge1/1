This includes phials of malt and hop varieties, hop pockets, brewing and malting equipment and other related items such as heavy horse brasses, barrels, coopering tools, pub signs, pub mirrors, beer bottles from the 1920s, beer engines, brewers' promotional ranges including bar towels. We also hope to provide a pub/brewing photographic and ephemera archive. All of these things were acquired by Tarant Hobbs, who created The World of Brewing Museum, when working for Courage Eastern at the Anchor Brewery, Shad Thames, by Tower Bridge in Southwark. In 1974, whilst a Management Consultant for the company, he began collecting and salvaging the items from closed pubs and breweries before managing the Museum, which was funded by Courage. The World of Brewing opened late 1979. After the brewery was taken over by Hanson Asset Strippers, the museum was sadly closed down in 1980, after only one year of operation. Tarant Hobbs continues to obtain anything of interest about brewing and pubs worldwide. We are always happy to receive anything that should be preserved from these important social industries, with a guarantee that the items will not be sold.</p><p style="text-align: center;"></p><hr /><p style="text-align: left;" /><ul><li><a href="https://bit.ly/3jEnZnr" target="_blank">Souvenir Shop sign</a></li><li><a href="https://bit.ly/3yxnXE7" target="_blank">The Spectator, 28 June 1980, page 30</a></li><li><a href="https://bit.ly/3lEQmV3" target="_blank">Hertfordshire CAMRA Newsletter, June 1980</a></li></ul><p /><hr /><p style="text-align: left;">Please send any contributions or enquiries to <a href="mailto:jakant@mail.com">jakant@mail.com</a>.

Dogs are welcome at Cedars Park and there is a community of regular
dog owners who choose to come here for their daily walks.

<P>The <B>Cedars Dog Walking Association</B> is a community project run by
a small group of park visitors, with the purpose of encouraging dog
owners to be responsible when in their local parks, compiling photos
of regular dogs in case a search party needs to be instigated for a
missing dog, and simply connecting the many dogs and owners who use
Cedars Park. This is done through their
<A HREF=https://instagram.com/cedarsdogwalkingassociation TARGET=_blank>Instagram page</A>
and <A HREF=https://cedarspark.proboards.com/board/6/dog-walkers TARGET=_blank>internet forum</A>.
If you would like to submit a photograph of your dog to be uploaded,
please e-mail this to
<a href="mailto:info.cedarspark@gmail.com">info.cedarspark@gmail.com</a>.

<H2>Cedars Park Canine Code</H2>
The association recommends the following when visiting the park:
<UL>
<LI>Your dog is wearing a name tag or is micro-chipped.
<LI>Your dog is on a lead if you are not confident that he/she will not cause fear or harm to other dogs or park visitors (particularly children)
<LI>Ensure that your dog does not foul near areas where children often play (such as the Venusberg and Maze)
<LI>Carry a sufficient amount of poo bags, ideally enough to spare some for another dog walker who may have forgotten theirs.
<LI>Pick up all dog poo, and ensure that bags are not left anywhere else other than in bins.
<LI>Regularly check/treat your dog for worms and fleas.
<LI>Never allow your dog to chase or attack wildlife.
</UL>

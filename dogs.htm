<p>Dogs are welcome at Cedars Park and there is a community of regular dog owners who choose to come here for their daily walks.</p>

<p>The Cedars Dog Walking Association is a community project run by a small group of people, with the purpose of encouraging dog owners to be responsible when in their local parks, compiling photos of regular dogs in case a search party needs to be instigated for a missing dog, and simply connecting the many dogs and owners who use Cedars Park. This is done through their <a href="https://instagram.com/cedarsdogwalkingassociation" target="_blank">Instagram page</a>. If you would like to submit a photograph of your dog to be uploaded, please e-mail this to <a href="mailto:info.cedarspark@gmail.com">info.cedarspark@gmail.com</a>.

<h3>Cedars Park Canine Code</h3>

It is expected that the following rules are followed while in Cedars Park:

<ul>
<li>Your dog is wearing a name tag or is micro-chipped.</li>
<li>Your dog is on a lead if you are not confident that he/she will not cause fear or harm to other dogs or park visitors (particularly children)</li>
<li>Ensure that your dog does not foul near areas where children often play (such as the Venusberg and Maze)</li>
<li>Carry a sufficient amount of poo bags, ideally enough to spare some for another dog walker who may have forgotten theirs.</li>
<li>Pick up all dog poo, and ensure that bags are not left anywhere else other than in bins.</li>
<li>Regularly check/treat your dog for worms and fleas.</li>
<li>Never allow your dog to chase or attack wildlife.</li>

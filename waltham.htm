The town of Waltham, Massachusetts, USA was established in 1634 by
settlers from Waltham Cross, Hertfordshire, England. Joseph B Franklin Esq,
the Chairman of Cheshunt Council, visited the American Waltham for an
early celebration of the tercentenary of the town's founding. He was
gifted an Amur Cork Tree, which he planted in Cedars Park on his return
home. In 1941, the American Waltham donated a mobile canteen (worth 1500
USD (around 21,000 today)) to the joint towns of Waltham Cross and Waltham
Abbey - the current location and condition of the mobile canteen are unknown.
After the Amur Cork Tree died from storm damage, the American Waltham
kindly donated a new one in August 1980, which later died. A new tree was
planted in recent years, which was ring-barked in 2019 (likely by muntjacs)
and died in 2020.<P>

WALTHAM (MASS.) TO
<BR />WALTHAM (ESSEX)
<BR />___
<P>Residents of Waltham, Mass., U.S.A.,<BR />
have decided to show their sympathy with<BR />
their namesake town, Waltham Abbey,<BR />
Essex, by providing, at a cost of 1,500<BR />
dollars, a mobile canteen for the use of<BR />
the joint parishes of Waltham Abbey and<BR />
Waltham Cross.  Further practical help<BR />
is also promised.
<P>The American Waltham, a town of<BR />
about 50,000 inhabitants, takes its name<BR />
from this Essex locality, from which<BR />
many of its original settlers came.  The<BR />
news of the gift was read by Mr J. B.<BR />
Franklin, J.P. who ten years ago, when<BR />
chairman of the local Urban Council,<BR />
visited America as the guest of Waltham,<BR />
Mass., on the occasion of that town's ter-<BR />
centenary.
<P>Some years ago the American city pre-<BR />
sented an Amur cork tree to Waltham<BR />
Cross, and this rare plant, the only one<BR />
of its kind in this country, is flourishing<BR />
in the Cedars Park, Waltham Cross.
<P>A prominent American Walthamite,<BR />
writing to Mr J. B. Franklin, says: "We<BR />
Americans admire the gallant fight you<BR />
Englishmen are making for the cause of<BR />
democracy."<BR />

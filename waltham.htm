<p>The town of Waltham, Massachusetts, USA was established in 1634 by settlers from Waltham Cross, Hertfordshire, England. Joseph B Franklin Esq, the Chairman of Cheshunt Council, visited the American Waltham for an early celebration of the tercentenary of the town's founding. He was gifted an Amur Cork Tree, which he planted in Cedars Park on his return home. In 1941, the American Waltham donated a mobile canteen (worth 1500 USD (around 21,000 today)) to the joint towns of Waltham Cross and Waltham Abbey - the current location and condition of the mobile canteen are unknown. After the Amur Cork Tree died from storm damage, the American Waltham kindly donated a new one in August 1980, which later died. A new tree was planted in recent years, which was ring-barked in 2019 (likely by muntjacs) and died in 2020.</p>

           WALTHAM (MASS.) TO
             WALTHAM (ESSEX)
                   ___

  Residents of Waltham, Mass., U.S.A.,
have decided to show their sympathy with
their namesake town, Waltham Abbey,
Essex, by providing, at a cost of 1,500
dollars, a mobile canteen for the use of
the joint parishes of Waltham Abbey and
Waltham Cross.  Further practical help
is also promised.
  The American Waltham, a town of
about 50,000 inhabitants, takes its name
from this Essex locality, from which
many of its original settlers came.  The
news of the gift was read by Mr J. B.
Franklin, J.P. who ten years ago, when
chairman of the local Urban Council,
visited America as the guest of Waltham,
Mass., on the occasion of that town's ter-
centenary.
  Some years ago the American city pre-
sented an Amur cork tree to Waltham
Cross, and this rare plant, the only one
of its kind in this country, is flourishing
in the Cedars Park, Waltham Cross.
  A prominent American Walthamite,
writing to Mr J. B. Franklin, says: "We
Americans admire the gallant fight you
Englishmen are making for the cause of
democracy."

<h1>A Veteran <abbr title="Royal Air Force">RAF</abbr> Serviceman's Experience</h1>

<p>I'm Tarant, and I live in the British Isles, which I'm very proud of, especially for our Empire and Colonial days, and I don't believe we have anything to apologise for, as I think we were quite a benign empire, and after all we were only competing with all the other countries who were trying to cut our trading routes abroad.</p>

<p>When I was 16, I joined the Royal Air Force as a Boy Entrant, as I was hoping one day that I would be able to fly an aircraft. It was two years training, and also they sent me to University, and when I finished training, I was a Work Study Officer, which nowadays equates to a Management Consultant. I wanted to join the Royal Air Force because my mother's youngest brother, who was also named Tarrant, but with two R's in his name, was a Lancaster Bomber Pilot during World War II, and I was very proud of him, and he was delighted that I wanted to join the Service. I was also privileged to have an older brother of my late mother, whose name was Lawrence, and he was with 7 Paras during World War II and landed in the Pegasus area on D-Day as a Pathfinder to set up radio beacons so the gliders were able to land right by the bridge to surprise the enemy.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I had a slight red-green colourblindness, which stopped me achieving my ambition of becoming a fighter pilot in the Royal Air Force. However, I still enjoyed my nearly 12 years service, travelling all over the world and seeing many things.</p>

<p>Some of the most interesting operations I was involved with was when I was in Cyprus and I had to be on the Green Line during the troubles between the Turkish-Cypriots and the Greek-Cypriots. One time, I did a 12-hour duty in Nicosia, and we were being shot at all the time by <abbr title="Ethniki Organosis Kyprion Agoniston (National Organisation of Cypriot Fighters)">EOKA</abbr>, the Greek-Cypriot terrorists, and the only friends we had there in a sense were the Turkish-Cypriot Volkans, who were an underground movement trying to protect their people from being murdered by the Greek-Cypriot terrorists.</p>

<p>Another was when stationed at Headquarters Far East Air Force at Changi in Singapore, Indonesians attempted to invade and annex Borneo, and during Operation Claret I had the harrowing task of helping to recover dead aircrew from helicopters that had accidentally crashed in the Jungle supporting our ground forces.</p>

<p>Once, en route to Singapore via the Maldives, we landed in Aden to refuel during a Radfan terrorist attack. We took to the air quickly in an RAF helicopter, and I manned a machine gun when gunfire flashed from the hillsides around - one of their rounds struck the bodywork.</p>

<p>Additionally, at home in Britain once, we had periods of defending American airbases in Suffolk during the height of the <abbr title="Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament">CND</abbr> Campaign against Greenham Common and nuclear weapons on US bases, only self-arming ourselves with balls of soft mud, which we exchanged with them as they attempted to breach the perimeter fences, as US Forces had been instructed to respond with live fire to protect their legal assets.</p>

<H2>Volunteer at the park</H2>

A great way to maintain physical and mental health, make new
friends, and improve Cedars Park is to help out at one of the park's
regular volunteering activities.

<P>The <A HREF=https://www.facebook.com/friendsofcedarspark/ TARGET=_blank>Friends of Cedars Park</A>
 is a volunteer group with the aim of
improving Cedars Park and organising community events.
Membership is free.

</A> also arrange events and activities to
support the local community, including gardening activities, and an
annual Grow Club competition for local schools which includes a public
fun day, often held at Cedars Park.

<H2>Respond to public appeals</H2>

As well as general information about Cedars Park, this website is
also used to recognise any faults in its management and attempt to
get public support in ensuring that these issues are dealt with
properly. Please see our <A HREF=appeals.htm>public appeals</A> page
and e-mail us to show your support.

<P>Public appeals existed on a previous site called "Jakant Research"
(which was mainly about Cedars Park), however they were
removed not long before <I>www.cedarspark.info</I> was created,
due to feedback that they were "too negative". However, it is clear
that there are areas in Cedars Park's management that are in dire need
of serious improvement, therefore these were re-added to the new site
on 28/6/2022.

<P>No responses were ever received when the original appeals were published,
which is a shame,
as the Cedars Park community do care about their park, however the
problem may be lack of recognition for this website. Therefore,
sharing of any pages/appeals would be very helpful.

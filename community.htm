<H2>Volunteering</H2>

A great way to maintain physical and mental health, make new
friends, and improve Cedars Park is to help out at one of the park's
regular volunteering activities.

<P>The Friends of Cedars Park is a volunteer group with the aim of
improving Cedars Park and organising community events.
Membership is free. If you would like to get involved with the
group, please see the group's

<P>Cheshunt Extended Services (ChExS) also arrange events and activities to
support the local community, including gardening activities, and an
annual Grow Club competition for local schools which includes a public
fun day, often held at Cedars Park. Please see their

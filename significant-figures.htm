He bought Theobalds in 1563 and accommodated the Queen on many occasions throughout the late 16th century.</p><p>On one of the Queen's visits in 1571, Cecil gifted her a drawing of the house. He was elevated to the Peerage the same year, becoming the Lord High Treasurer (Lord Burleigh), one of just 15 noblemen during the Elizabethan period. When Elizabeth visited the Palace in 1593, Cecil spent some 2500 pounds entertaining her.</p><p><i>' I meant it for a little place but must enlarge it for the Queen '</i><br />- Cecil had originally planned to keep Theobalds as a quiet family estate, but following Elizabeth's first visit he decided to enlarge and heavily renovate it to better accommodate her.</p></td></tr><tr><td style="width: 100%;"><p><a href="https://bit.ly/3Fw8BTY"><img src="https://bit.ly/3DvjYKj" align="left" style="margin-right: 0.6em;" /></a></p><p><a href="https://bit.ly/3oNnhbx"><img src="https://bit.ly/3lttmbc" align="right" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0" style="margin-left: 0.6em;" /></a></p><p><b></b></p><p><b><br />Queen Elizabeth I</b></p><p>Elizabeth I stayed at Theobalds at least 15 times.

King James I arrived at the Palace for the first time on 3 May 1603 and Cecil looked after him and his associates.</p><p>Cecil accommodated James I &amp; Christian IV of Denmark for 5 days in 1606. The organised entertainments did not go to plan as most of the participants had been drinking heavily prior to the performance. This visit cost Cecil 1487 pounds.</p><p>In 1607, James I swapped Hatfield House with Cecil for Theobalds.</p><p><i>' The Queen calls me her little elf '</i><br />- Robert Cecil may have assisted his father William in looking after Elizabeth I on her visits to Theobalds. Robert may have acted as a servant to the Queen.

Hunting was a favourite pastime of the Royal Family during the 17th century and they enjoyed many sessions at Theobalds.</p><p>In 1620, the King had a brick wall built around the estate. On an evening horse ride on 9 January 1622, he fell into the icy New River and was helped out by Sir Richard Young, who returned him to a warm bed at Theobalds.</p><p>James I died at Theobalds on 27 March 1625.</p><p><i>' Jewel was my favourite hound '</i><br />- In 1613, Queen Anne accidentally shot and killed the King's favourite dog Jewel during a hunting session.

Hedworth inherited the grounds from Lady Valerie Meux under the condition that he change his surname to match hers (his family surname is Lambton). By 1919, Sir Hedworth Meux owned Theobalds and generously donated most of its grounds to the people of Cheshunt, to be used as a public park called The Cedars.

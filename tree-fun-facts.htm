Sadly, global warming currently threatens around 18,000.</p><p>Alder - 'Care' and 'Generosity'. Associated with the Goddess of Spinning, as makes good dye. Celtics associated it with death, and many feared the tree because it bleeds when cut. Alders were also used to make measuring rods for corpses and coffins. Venice was built with this tree for the piling and some of them are 1200 years old.</p><p>Ash - 'Grandeur' and 'Prudence'. Burnt to ward off evil spirits - the Vikings revered it. In Norse mythology, lgdrasil (Ash Tree of Existence) had its roots deep down in the kingdoms of Hela (Death) and gods held their court under a huge ash tree. The Lance used by British Army Cavalry in the 19th century were made of ash until 1868, and then bamboo - finally, the Lance was abolished by the British Army in 1928. The Ash is the second most profilic tree in Britain, after the Oak.</p><p>Aspen - It is believed that Aspen sticks can kill vampires and werewolves. The Aspen trees in Sweden are the main sustainable source for the world's boxed matches. Red Indians used Aspen leaves to treat burns, swollen joints and headache, as well as bark for stomach and urinary infections.</p><p>Beech - 'Prosperity', 'Protection and Nurture', 'Knowledge'. Associated with femininity. Fagus was the Celtic god of beeches. Perfect for smoking herrings, and the nuts may be a good coffee substitute. Recently discovered by National Geographic researchers, the southernmost tree in the world, located in Cape Horn, Chile, is a Magellan's Beech (<i>Nothofagus betuloides</i>). Sir Joseph Banks collected a specimen of the tree from the Tierra del Fuego Archipelago in South America in 1769, during Captain James Cook's first voyage. It was thought to be extinct so far south, until its recent re-discovery.</p><p>Birch - 'Meekness'. Celtics symbolised it as growth and renewal.</p><p>Cork - In Ancient Greece, Cork trees were revered as a symbol of 'Freedom' and 'Honour'.</p><p>Crab Apples - In Egremont, the Lake District, there is an annual Crab Fair. This fair began in 1267 by the Lord of Egremont when he gave away crab apples from his orchard to the local people.</p><p>Cypress - Some associated this tree with 'Death', 'Despair' and 'Mourning'. In contrast, it is a Turkish symbol of 'Life' and 'Immortality'. Assyrian Youth, Cyparissus, accidentally killed his pet stag - the Gods took pity and turned him into this tree!</p><p>Elm - 'Dignity', 'Melancholy', and 'Death'. It is often used for coffins. In Scandinavian and Germanic mythology, it created the first woman. An ancient Elm tree (known as L'ormeteau-Ferre) was chosen at Gisors in Normandy, on the Epte River as a meeting point between the French King and the Norman Duke, at the area called the Vexin - the Vikings had arrived in the 9th century to siege Paris, and by the 10th century had created Normandy under Rolt, the Dane, to settle there. King Philip Augustus had it cut down as negotiations for territory between Henry II were at an end (Kings John and Henry had controlled the Norman Barons).</p><p>Fir - 'Time'. Evergreens symbolised eternal life in Ancient Egypt and China. The Druids thought they represented 'Truth' as they were strong and straight. Scandinavian legend of a boy lost on Christmas Eve and found under a Fir tree created the Christmas Tree tradition, as the ice on them shone in the sunlight to find the boy. Christmas Trees then came to Germany and to Britain in the 19th century.</p><p>Hawthorn - Some Christians believe that a crown of Hawthorn branches were stabbed into Jesus Christ's head on his Crucifixion. A Hawthorn in Bristol has been turned into a 'Wishing Tree' during the Covid-19 Pandemic, on which ribbons have been placed in memory of those who have died from the virus.</p><p>Hazel - 'Reconciliation'. Iron Age man thought it offered wisdom and inspiration. Branches were used to protect against evil spirits and still for water-divining. In Irish, Norse and Roman mythology is known as the 'Tree of Knowledge'.</p><p>Holly - 'Foresight' and 'Truth'. It is also a fertility symbol, and considered unlucky to cut down this tree. Romans sent boughs to friends during Saturnalia winter festivals. Druids wore in the hair to ward off evil spirits, and it is associated with fire. According to some old tales, Hollies scare off evil spirits and witches.</p><p>Hornbeam - Both 'Meekness' and 'Confidence'! Also 'Strength' and 'Optimism'. One of the hardest temperate woods, also known as Ironwood. The 'beam' in the name was an Anglo-Saxon word for 'tree'. 'Horn' is referring to the rugged and horny texture, although it could also be said that it was named this from the Old English word 'horn' which meant 'hard' (due to the tree's strength). The drooping fruits are known as 'samaras'. Hornbeam wood was used for wheels, screws, and butchers' chopping boards. Drinks containing hornbeam are believed to energise, and its leaves have been used to treat wounds.</p><p>Chestnut - 'Luxury'. Horse Chestnuts are thought to have originated from the Ottoman Empire, and were ground up and fed to horses as a stimulant, making their coats shine, and as a cough remedy. The magnificent ancient carved beams of Westminster Hall's roof is made of chestnut (King Richard II).</p><p>Larch - 'Audacity' and 'Boldness', also 'Connection with the Earth'. Eurasian Shamanists regarded as the 'world tree'. Many Viking ships were made of Siberian Larch, as well as many of Russia's oldest buildings. The Shigir Idol, the oldest known wooden sculpture in the World, is made of Larch.</p><p>Laurel - Mountain Nymph Daphne was pursued in Arcadia by the god Apollo - she pleaded with Mother Earth for help and was turned into a Laurel.</p><p>Lime - 'Conjugal Love', 'Romance' and 'The Tree of Lovers'. Also 'Truth', 'Fairness', 'Justice' and 'Liberty'. Sacred tree in Slavic mythology, thought to protect against ill luck and lightning strikes. Germanic judicial cases were tried under it. Fibres were used for Bronze Age clothing, and Germanic tribes made lime-wood shields.</p><p>Maidenhair - Maidenhair (Ginkgo) Trees are the only surviving member of ancient tree groups before conifers, and have been used in medicine since very early human history. Carbon impressions have been found in fossilised rocks from the Permian Period (290-248 million years ago). Some of the best fossils are from the Jurassic Strata of North Yorkshire. The tree's scientific name, Gingko biloba, means 'Bi-lobed Silver Apricot', after translation from Chinese and Latin ('Ginkgo' comes from the Chinese 'Yinxing').</p><p>Maple - 'Reserve'. Symbolises strength and endurance. Prized by the Romans for carving, and given its name by the Anglo-Saxons.</p><p>Mistletoe - 'Romance' and 'Fertility'. This tree is supposed to have come from the Moon. It is a Christmas tradition to kiss under these branches. The Celtic Druids of the 1st Century administered it to humans and other animals to improve fertility.</p><p>Monkey Puzzle - 'Conundrums' and 'Adventure'. In a graveyard, it prevents the devil from joining a burial. Originally known as 'Chilean Pine', the tree was named Monkey Puzzle in the 19th century after Charles Auston saw a young tree in 1850 and commented 'it would puzzle a monkey to climb that'. The trees can withstand intense heat, such as from lava and bushfires.</p><p>Mulberry - 'Wisdom', and 'Appreciation for the Earth'. Buddhist books were made from its bark, and dry wood is used for smoking meats.</p><p>'Nepotistic Trees' can nourish each other through billions of gossamer-like fine-tube hyphae that are created by fungi around their roots. This is a recent discovery and these networks allow trees as far as 60 feet apart to collaborate. They allow 'mother' trees to feed saplings with carbon, nitrogen and water, as they struggle in the shade beneath high canopies. While the mother trees feed saplings of all species, they feed rather more to those of their own - and give the most food to those that are closely related. Studies show that pairs of related trees recognise the root tips of their kin, among those of unrelated trees, enabling a kind of arboreal nepotism to thrive.</p><p>Oak - 'Strength', 'Endurance' and 'Stability'. Associated with Norse and Finnish Thunder Gods, Thor and Jumala, as well as the Roman Jupiter and Greek Zeus. Sacred to the Druids and is the tree most likely to be struck by lightning. Bronze Age henges (ceremonial oak rings) found in Norfolk have been dated 2049 B.C. The Royal Navy's 'Walls of Old England' were oak-constructed ships, and HMS Victory consumed 5000 oaks in its build. Henry III gave the Monks of Worcester 100 Oak Trees for the roof of the new cathedral that covered the tomb of his father, King John. The English Oak is the most common tree in Britain, and more than half of the world's Oaks are located here. An Oak tree from the Royal estate at Sandringham was chosen to build the coffin for King George VI. On 2/8/1100, King William II (Rufus) was accidentally killed by an arrow deflected from an Oak whilst stag-hunting in the New Forest, Hampshire. Today, the Rufus Stone stands on the site of that tree. On 26/3/2015, the remains of King Richard III (the last Plantagenet King, who died at the Battle of Bosworth (Ambion Hill) on 22/8/1485 and was the final act in the Wars of the Roses, the Tudors being the victors) were re-buried in Leicester Cathedral in an English Oak coffin, made by one of his ancestors (a Canadian wood-carver). It is traditional for English Kings to be buried in an English Oak coffin encased in a lead coffin, used by the Romans to preserve the body. The skeleton was discovered by Archaeologists in September 2012, in a Leicester City Centre car park that was on the site of Grey Friars Priory. On the grounds of Windsor Castle, there is an ancient Oak estimated to be over 900 years old, which started to grow during Henry I's reign and is much loved by the Royal Family. The Major Oak in Sherwood Forest in Nottinghamshire was the meeting place of Robin Hood and his Merry Band, according to folklore. A Shire Oak (or Skyrack) near Headingley, Leeds marked the boundary of the Norse Wapentake. The Gog and Magog Oaks near Glastonbury, Somerset were named after two giants from Celtic mythology. Big Belly Oak in Savernake Forest is 1000 years old. There is a belief that the devil will appear to anyone who dances naked round it at midnight. Herne's Oak in Windsor Great Park was involved in a feud between King Richard II and his keeper, and is mentioned in Shakespeare's &quot;Merry Wives of Windsor&quot;. According to some sources, the English Oak originated from Cornwall or Devon.</p><p>Plane - 'Genius'. The London Plane represents half of London's trees, and is believed to be a mix of the Oriental Plane and American Sycamore. Around 486 BC, King Xerxes of Persia was distracted by the beauty of a Plane tree on his way to conquer Greece. His distraction caused him to fail his conquest, and allowed the Athenian Empire to prosper. At Emmanuel College in Cambridge, there is a Fellows' Garden containing a 200 year old Oriental Plane</p><p>Poplar - 'Beauty' in Ukraine. Denotes 'emotion' and 'sorrow'. It clones itself on long root systems. The Neanderthals used Poplars to relieve toothache - fossils of jaws and loose teeth have been found packed with material from the tree. They also twisted the fibres to make strings. Greek heroes wore poplar garlands in battle. The Greek Sungod Helios' son, Phaethon, died by a lightning bolt, and Zeus turned the tearful female mourners into a cluster of Poplars. Hercules tied its leaves into a victory wreath after defeating the giant, Cacus. There are 8000 Black Poplars in Great Britain, of which there are a large number in the Lea Valley.</p><p>Rowan - 'Prudence' and 'Delightful to the Eye'. Grown in churchyards and houses to protect from evil, and a barrier against witches. It also symbolises 'following your heart'.</p><p>Sycamore - 'Curiosity'. Symbolises divinity, eternity and strength. Its sap can make beer and its nectar is excellent for honey. The Hebrew word is 'shikma', meaning 'Regeneration'. This species retains its leaves well into the winter, and its flaky bark provides a winter home for many insects.</p><p>Walnut - 'Intellect', 'Self-Worth' and 'Stratagem'. The nut resembles the human brain, and is said to be good for it. Husks can be used to create rich dyes.</p><p>Willow - 'Mourning', 'Grief', 'Sadness', 'Sorrow' and 'The Subconscious World'. Witches' brooms were made from its twigs. The 'Weeping' name comes from the Bible's Psalm 137. They grew on Napoleon's grave at Saint Helena in 1892. Branches were used for Palm Sunday as palms were not grown in Britain.</p><p>Yew - 'Sorrow', 'Immortality', 'Omen of Doom' and 'Perspective'. Planted on plague graves for purification and protection. The Romans believed it grew in Hell. Norse men and Celts thought it prevented bewitching and death, while Christians believed its poison protected the dead. Branches are carried on Palm Sunday and at funerals. The trees were used to make the famous English Longbows of the successful battles of Crecy (26/8/1346), Poitiers (19/9/1356) and Azincourt/Agincourt (25/10/1415). At Twyford Churchyard, there is a Yew tree over a thousand years old.</p><div style="text-align: left;"><i><font size="2">Researched and compiled by Jakant Research as part of the <a href="tree-project.htm">Arboretum Identification Project</a> in Cedars Park, Cheshunt, Hertfordshire. </font></i><i style="font-size: small;">Last updated 2/12/2021</i></div></body></html>

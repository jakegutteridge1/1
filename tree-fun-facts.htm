<h3>'Nepotistic' Trees</h3>

<ul>
<li>Can nourish each other through billions of gossamer-like fine-tube hyphae that are created by fungi around their roots.
<br />This is a recent discovery and these networks allow trees as far as 60 feet apart to collaborate. They allow 'mother' trees to feed saplings with carbon, nitrogen and water, as they struggle in the shade beneath high canopies.
<br />While the mother trees feed saplings of all species, they feed rather more to those of their own - and give the most food to those that are closely related. Studies show that pairs of related trees recognise the root tips of their kin, among those of unrelated trees, enabling a kind of arboreal nepotism to thrive.</li>

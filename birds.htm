Many bird species have been observed in Cedars Park. Naturally, they
come and go, however on any visit to the park a wide variety of
different birds can be seen, since the area provides a quiet
"green space" with plenty of trees, making a perfect habitat, in
stark contrast to the busy urban areas around the park, and many on
these list are permanently resident in the park.

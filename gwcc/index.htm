<p>This is Cedars Park's War Memorial, which is primarily in memory of the Fallen in the First World War, however it also commemorates and respects those lost in other conflicts.</p>

<p>The two main parts of this Memorial are the WWI replica tank and Tommy Statue, which may be expanded upon below, however there is also a Centennial Bench made of steel, with imagery of poppies and soldiers walking to war. The bench was produced by <a href="https://www.davidogilvie.com/ww1-seat" target="_blank">David Ogilvie Engineering</a>, and several benches with this design can be found across the country.</p>

<p>A remembrance service is held at this war memorial every Armistice Day. Photographs of past services have been compiled <a href="https://bit.ly/3b7yyey" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

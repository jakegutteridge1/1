<h1>Cedars Park's Tank</h1>

<iframe src="./Tank Images/1.htm" width="550" height="360" style="border: 0;"></iframe>

<p>In 1921, the National War Savings Committee donated a tank to Cheshunt, which was placed on a plinth in Cedars Park. This was part of 265 'presentation tanks' (235 Females and 30 Males) given to communities across Britain to acknowledge their financial contributions to the war effort. The Cedars Park tank was 2740, a Female (machine guns only) Mark IV, built at Fosters of Lincoln. In a time of need during the Second World War, the tank was sold by Messrs Cox & Danks for 27 pounds, 16 shillings and 10 pence, which supported the war effort. Sadly, most presentation tanks were poorly cared for and ended up in a state of disrepair, subsequently being destroyed (most sold for scrap), the only surviving original being another Female Mark IV located in St George's Square in Ashford, Kent.</p>

<p>2740 was in 'D' Battalion first saw Action in the III Battle of Ypres (Passchendaele), supporting 18 Div of the Second Army on 12/8/1917 in the Advance on St. Julien, just NE of Ypres, becoming Ditched as very soft wet ground following prolonged heavy rain. On 22/8/1917, 2740 received a direct hit from a German shell, which resulted in it being transferred to the Army Service Corps in early 9/1917 and converted to a 'Top-Draw Sledge Hauler' (a vehicle designed to pull a supply sledge which carried food, fuel and ammunition to the Front, over the churned-up conditions of war), only retaining its machine gun armament in a defensive role. About a year later, production of its successor - the Mark V - began, and slowly the remaining Mark IVs were taken out of First Line Action and reserved as backup tanks.</p>

<p>In 2004, producers at Pinewood Film Studios commissioned the creation of a replica 'Male' Mark IV tank, named "Frank", which was used for the films <i>The Magic Flute</i>, <i>Wonder Woman</i> and <i>Transformers 5</i>. Military vehicle hobbyists Tony Cooke and Kevin Jepson later acquired the tank and carried out an extensive refurbishment. The tank is 13 feet wide and 21 feet long, and weighs 6&half; tonnes, much less than an original (which weighs around 18 tonnes) thanks to wooden plasticised tracks being used as opposed to metal on the original. Otherwise, the guns and machinery have been accurately replicated. It is slightly shorter than an original, so as to make it easier to move around on film sets.</p>

<p>This tank was briefly placed on the Cedars Park tank plinth in 2018 to commemorate the Centenary of the Great War Armistice, however it was removed. At this time, it had the inaccurate markings '4086' and 'A1'. Shortly after, the tracks and Ford Transit engine were removed to be used in the construction of a 'Medium Mark A Whippet' replica. Broxbourne Council purchased the external body for use as a presentation tank in Cedars Park, and in the first half of 2019, the body was painted in <a href="https://www.valsparpaint.co.uk/colours/pre-selected-colours/yellows/wagon-train/" target="_blank">Valspar "Wagon Train"</a>. The tank was brought into the park on 1/7/2019, being placed on the original presentation plinth. Support chocks were later added by Jakant Research. This is the only known replica to be placed on an original tank plinth - after their presentation tanks were removed, all other plinths were destroyed or remain bare today.</p>

<p>"Frank" remembers all who served in the Tank Regiments during the Great War, and an identity has been heavily researched with the help of many experts and museums to be contemporary with the Active Service of the original Cedars Tank. Our replica is based on 2325, a 'Male' Mark IV (machine guns and cannons) of 'G' Battalion of 6th Section (part of HQ Section), 20 Company, and listed as the 22nd Battalion Tank (i.e. G 22) - named "Grasshopper" by the Crew. 'G' Battalion fought alongside 'D' Battalion of '2740' on 12/8/1917 and was commanded by New Zealander Second Lieutenant George Ranald MacDonald - the Tank was 'Knocked Out of Action' with right track broken. On 22/8/1917, '2325' was transferred to 12 Company of 'D' Battalion and in Action 'Broke Down and was Ditched'. It does not appear to have returned to 'G' Battalion or even survived, as a "Grasshopper II" existed later in the Battalion.

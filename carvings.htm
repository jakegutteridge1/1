<p>These wooden features were added to Cedars Park around 2014 as part of the Heritage Lottery grant restoration project. The camel, tiger and elephant represent some animals that were kept on the grounds of Theobalds - <i>five camels, mules, flying squirrels, a sable, a white hind, elk, fifty herons, twenty French fowl, and an elephant</i>. It was reported in 1623 that the elephant was fed a gallon of wine each day during cold times, to keep him warm.</p>

<p>A puzzle totem pole depicts faces and outfits of people from the Elizabethan, Tudor and Georgian eras. These are in three axised sections, so that people can mix up the costumes and try to work out which sections match. This is fun for children and adults alike!</p>

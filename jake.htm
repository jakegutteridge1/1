<hr />

<p>I am a 17-year-old amateur historical researcher working with my grandfather <a href="tarant.htm">Tarant Hobbs</a> to compile information about <a href="https:/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theobalds" target="_blank">Theobalds Palace</a> and <a href="https://cedarspark.org" target="_blank">Cedars Park</a> in Cheshunt.</p>

<p>Please visit the <a href="index.htm">main index</a> for all pages about those topics. THIS page is for pages of my own personal interest, some of which have something to do with Cedars Park but they are mostly unrelated.</p>

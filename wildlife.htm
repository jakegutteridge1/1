<p>Two terrapins have lived in the pond at Cedars Park for many years. They are believed to be Red-Eared Sliders and may have been placed there in the late 1980s/early 1990s during the height of the &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot; cartoon popularity, when many people bought terrapins as pets but could not look after them, subsequently releasing them in nearby waters. Our terrapins are usually out of sight, but can occasionally be seen basking on the rocks. It is unknown if they hibernate. It is likely that they are both the same gender, as they do not appear to have had any young.</p>

<p>Sadly, due to the Environmental Agency specifications that Broxbourne Council is licenced under, there are plans to remove the terrapins from the pond, as they are deemed an invasive species which can cause a salmonella risk. We hope that this does not go through, as birds and insects have always thrived in the Cedars Park pond, and the water does not appear to be contaminated.</p>

<p>A visitor to Cedars Park shared <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryb_V2KZSLo" target="_blank">this video</a> on YouTube, showing what is believed to be a Great Crested Newt in the pond.</p>

<p>Birds of many different species live in Cedars Park, including but not limited to: Ring-Necked Parakeets, Crimson Rosellas, Grey Wagtails, Green Woodpeckers, Jays, Red Kites, and White Doves released at Armistice Day services. Also, Mallard Ducks and Moorhens live in the pond.</p>

<p>As well as the Park's natural inhabitants, <a href="https://www.cedarsnaturecentre.co.uk/our-animals" target="_blank">Cedars Nature Centre</a> (previously Pets Corner) cares for a wide variety of exotic mammals, reptiles, birds, fish and invertebrates.</p>

<p>Flowers in the park include daffodils, crocuses, snowdrops, primroses, and many more. The Rose Arch is a cylindrical pathway which was formerly abundant in thickly-grown flower branches, however in recent years the planting has become thin (possibly due to budget cuts by Broxbourne Council) and the Friends of Cedars Park are currently working to revive the feature.</p>

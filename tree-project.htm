There is a list of?<a href="https://web.fc2.com/en/tree-fun-facts.htm">tree fun facts</a>?mainly pertaining to the different species found at Cedars Park. Two notable tree species in Cedars Park are Andean Oak, which is a tree apparently only found in Colombia and Panama, and it is unheard of for it to be found anywhere else. Ours is a fairly young tree and information &amp; photos in books and websites gives us strong reason to believe that this identification is correct. Another is Crimson King Maple, which is a prize-winning species whose leaves are a dark purple colour in the summer, then a rich red in the autumn.</div><div style="font-size: medium; font-weight: 400; text-align: left;"><br />The Park has several very large London Plane trees. An independent analysis by some members of the Park community found that the London Planes near the duck pond have an average girth of 6.55 metres, which a specialist confirmed equals over 400 years of age, meaning that they were likely planted at a time when Royalty were staying at Theobalds Palace, which stood on the grounds. John Tradescant was Head Gardener at Hatfield House before the Cecil family moved to Theobalds - it is believed that it was in Tradescant's garden in Vauxhall that the hybrid tree which would become known as the London Plane was created.</div></h1><h1 style="text-align: center;"><div style="font-size: medium; font-weight: 400; text-align: left;">Two Amur Cork Trees were donated to Waltham Cross and planted in Cedars Park by Waltham, Massachusetts, USA in the 1930s and 1980s. These both died and a new one was planted in recent years - this tree was ring-barked in 2019 and died in 2020. More information on this subject can be found?<a href="https://web.fc2.com/en/waltham.htm">here</a>.</div><hr /></h1><h3 style="font-size: medium; text-align: left;">Identification Project</h3><div style="font-size: medium; font-weight: 400; text-align: left;">A major project commenced 2019 in Cedars Park with the aim of responding to visitors' comments about tree species, especially for those that are in memory of a late relative or friend. The Park is now undergoing a detailed identification project for all of its trees, excluding areas of dense tree population. The Park has been split into zones A to E. All identified trees have a designated number, marked on a white disc. Species identification was mostly completed early September 2021, with a few trees having to be identified in 2022 due to leaves falling off in the autumn. The project would have been completed sooner if we had not been hindered by the Covid Pandemic. <b>Tree Identification Booklets are available in the Park Cafe for 20p to cover printing costs - please request these from the Staff</b>. These booklets are currently zonal, as they have been since the start of the project, however we are in the process of compiling them into a single, larger booklet. Also, a list of tree species by total number in the park can be found <a href="cedars-tree-species.txt" target="_blank">here</a>.</div><p>As well as tree identification, the project also focuses on Memorials. There are many Memorial numbers for trees and benches in the Park. A full list can be viewed <a href="memorials.htm">here</a> and we would be grateful for any information about missing names, to our e-mail address, <a href="mailto:jakant@mail.com">jakant@mail.com</a>.</p><p /><p style="text-align: left;">We are not responsible for any poisoning as a result of our tree identifications. While research has been carried out to a very high standard and is likely to be accurate, errors are of course possible. Therefore, please do not eat any plants marked as edible fruits without also doing your own checks.</p><h3 style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://bit.ly/3vDYkk2"><img src="https://bit.ly/3jdPEfW" align="left" style="margin-right: 0.6em;" /></a></h3><p style="text-align: center;"><b><br />Each zone has its own unique name, reflecting a piece of the park's history:</b></p><p><b>A - Deer Park</b> - In 1607 and 1620, James I expanded Theobalds to create a 2500-acre deer hunting ground, which was enclosed by a ten mile long brick wall. Hunting was a favourite pastime of the Royals at the time.</p><p><b>B - Great Garden</b> - This was Sir William Cecil's garden that he designed for Queen Elizabeth I, with elaborate flowerbeds, fountains and garden buildings, as well as bee boles in the garden wall. The Queen is thought to have held several social gatherings at this venue, organised by Cecil.</p><p><b>C - The Cedars</b> - Original name of the park, and a <a href="theobalds-square.htm">property</a> that stood on the grounds (whose smaller buildings are now the cafe &amp; meeting room/toilet blocks - the central building was destroyed).</p><p><b>D - Pond Quarter</b> - The duck pond is located in this area.</p><p><b>E - Great War Centennial Corner</b> - Location of the Park's <a href="gwcc.htm">War Memorial</a>.</p><h1 style="text-align: center;"><u><u><u><u><img src="https://bit.ly/30XES6M" usemap="#image-map" />

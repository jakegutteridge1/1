The gates at the main pedestrian entrance of
Cedars Park were installed in 2002 to commemorate the
Golden Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II's reign. Bronze roundels depict
key historical events and figures in the grounds' history. Many public
parks <A HREF=https://historicengland.org.uk/images-books/publications/jubilee-ation/jubilee-parks/
TARGET=_blank>had features commissioned</A> for this special event,
recognised throughout the British Empire, however Cedars Park's is perhaps the
most significant outside of the Royal Parks, as being the grounds of
the former Theobalds Palace &ndash; a much-loved holiday home for
Queen Elizabeth I, which later became King James I's favourite estate
and hunting grounds, where he lived for most of his later life.

The park has always had an impressive <A HREF=../arboretum/index.htm>arboretum</A>. The large
London Planes are estimated to have been planted during the period
when Elizabeth I stayed at Theobalds.

The Queen's second visit in 1571 was her first following an

Following Sir William Cecil's death in 1598, his son Robert
inherits Theobalds.

as he made his first recorded visit the same year.

The Civil War began in 1642, and the lead from the roofs at Theobalds
was sold to support the troops.

A survey of the property deems it to be in excellent condition
and not fit for demolition, however this was misread and a large
portion was destroyed.

The estate was granted to George Monck in 1661.

(now on opposite side of A10).

"The Cedars" was opened to the public on 2 July 1921.

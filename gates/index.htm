<H1>Cedars Park Celebration Gates</H1>
<H2>with key events in the history of the park's grounds</H2>

<IMG SRC=gates.jpg>
</CENTER>

<P>The gates at Cedars Park were installed in 2002 to commemorate the
Golden Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II's reign. Bronze roundels depict
key historical events and figures in the grounds' history. Many public
parks <A HREF=https://historicengland.org.uk/images-books/publications/jubilee-ation/jubilee-parks/
TARGET=_blank>had features commissioned</A> for this special event,
recognised throughout the Empire, however Cedars Park's is perhaps the
most significant outside of the Royal Parks, as being the grounds of
the former Theobalds Palace &ndash; a much-loved holiday home for
Queen Elizabeth I, which later became King James I's favourite estate
and hunting grounds, where he lived for most of his later life.

We know just from the name that there was one in the Fountain Court. The most central section of the Great Garden contained a white marble fountain, with hidden pipes that would spray unwary passers-by.</p><p>There was also a miniature ship with cannons, flags and sails. A single wide canal, with fish in abundance, surrounded most of these gardens. A visitor once described an ornamental pond with two wooden water-mills as 'delightful and most beautifully made'.</p><p>During the 18th century, <a href="theobalds-square.htm">several large houses</a> were built on the site of Theobalds Palace, each with its own water garden. The Cedars looked out over a T-shaped pond, designed to reflect the <a href="http://jakant.web.fc2.com/flint-arch.htm">Flint Arch</a>. The pond was filled in when the gardens became Cedars Park, but is now a sunken swamp which collects water after heavy rain. A small well from Old Palace House remains near the car park.</p><p>There was also a boating pond in the northwestern corner of today's Park area, but this was filled in sometime between 1898 and the early 1960s.</p><p>Today, the Cedars Park pond features a modest water feature in the centre, made from a plastic container. Birds can often be seen enjoying a massage by the falling water.</body></html>

<H2>Sir William Cecil</H2>

<IMG SRC=portraits/william-cecil.jpg STYLE=float:right;margin-left:8px>

William Cecil was Queen Elizabeth I's Chief Advisor for most of her
reign. He bought Theobalds in 1563 and accommodated the Queen on many
occasions throughout the late 16th century.

<P>On one of the Queen's visits in 1571, Cecil gifted her a drawing
of the house. He was elevated to the Peerage the same year, becoming
the Lord High Treasurer (Lord Burleigh), one of just 15 noblemen
during the Elizabethan period. When Elizabeth visited the Palace in
1593, Cecil spent some 2500 pounds entertaining her.

<P>
<B>
<Q>I meant it for a little place but must enlarge it for the Queen</Q>
</B>
<BR>- Cecil had originally planned to keep Theobalds as a quiet family
estate, but following Elizabeth's first visit he decided to enlarge and
heavily renovate it to better accommodate her.

<H2>Queen Elizabeth I</H2>

<img src=portraits/elizabeth.jpg STYLE=float:right;margin-left:8px>

Elizabeth I stayed at Theobalds at least 15 times. Outdoor entertainments
were held in the <A HREF=../great-garden.htm>Great Garden</A>.

<P>
<B>
<Q>But I have the heart &amp; stomach of a King</Q>
</B>
<BR>- The Queen is suggesting that she is strong enough for activities
usually considered manly, such as hunting. It is possible that she hunted
at Theobalds.

<H2>Sir Robert Cecil</H2>

<IMG SRC=plaques/robert-cecil.jpg STYLE=float:left;margin-right:8px>
<IMG SRC=portraits/robert-cecil.jpg STYLE=float:right;margin-left:8px>

Following the death of his father William in 1598, Robert Cecil inherited
Theobalds. King James I arrived at the Palace for the first time on
3 May 1603 and Cecil looked after him and his associates.

<P>Cecil accommodated James I (of England) &amp; Christian IV of Denmark
for 5 days in 1606. The organised entertainments did not go to plan as
most of the participants had been drinking heavily prior to the performance.
Hosting this visit is reported to have cost Cecil 1487 pounds.

<P>In 1607, James I swapped Hatfield House with Cecil for Theobalds.

<P>
<B>
<Q>The Queen calls me her little elf</Q>
</B>
<BR>- Robert Cecil may have assisted his father William in looking after
Elizabeth I on her visits to Theobalds. Robert may have acted as a servant
to the Queen. Since he was younger than her, she chose to call him a 'little elf'.

<H2>King James I</H2>

<IMG SRC=plaques/james.jpg STYLE=float:left;margin-right:8px>
<IMG SRC=portraits/james.jpg STYLE=float:right;margin-left:8px>

James I first visited Theobalds in 1603 and fell in love with the place,
spending much of his later life (and dying) there.

<P>Following his and Queen Anne's acquisition of the estate in 1607,
the King had a 2500-acre deer hunting ground created. Hunting was a
favourite pastime of the Royal Family during the 17th century and they
enjoyed many sessions at Theobalds.

<P>In 1620, the King had a brick wall built around the estate.
On an evening horse ride on 9 January 1622, he fell into the icy New River
and was helped out by Sir Richard Young, who returned him to a warm bed
at Theobalds.

<P>The King died at Theobalds on 27 March 1625.

<P>
<B>
<Q>Jewel was my favourite hound</Q>
</B>
<BR>- In 1613, Queen Anne accidentally shot and killed the King's favourite
dog Jewel during a hunting session. After some initial rage, he presented
Anne with a diamond worth 2000 pounds (although records suggest he paid 1500)
in memory of the dog and as an apology for his anger.

<H2>Munten Jennings</H2>

<IMG SRC=plaques/jennings.jpg STYLE=float:left;margin-right:8px>

Munten Jennings was Robert Cecil's gardener at Theobalds until James I
acquired the estate. He then served as both Jame I's gardener at Theobalds
and Cecil's at Hatfield House. He also served as the gardener at
Cranborne Manor. Jennings also went by the forename of Mountain and Montague.
The nearby Montayne Road may be named after him.

<P>
<B>
<Q>Silkworms flourish on my mulberry trees</Q>
</B>
<BR>- Jennings was ordered by James I to build a silkworm house at Theobalds,
and the silkworms were fed the leaves of mulberry trees.

<H2>King Charles I</H2>

<IMG SRC=plaques/charles.jpg STYLE=float:left;margin-right:8px>

Charles inherited Theobalds from James I. He added several carvings and
paintings of stag heads to the Great Gallery. Despite a very happy childhood
at Theobalds, Charles had complained in 1624 that there were no birds to hunt,
therefore he only stayed there on occasion.

<P>
<B>
<Q>My early years were so happily spent in play at Theobalds</Q>

<H2>Major-General William Packer</H2>

<IMG SRC=plaques/packer.jpg STYLE=float:left;margin-right:8px>

William Packer was a Major General during the Civil War. To support the troops,
he sold the lead from buildings at Theobalds that had either been demolished
for this purpose or destroyed in the War. It is believed that George Prescott
used the remaining unsold materials over a century later, to build
<A HREF=../theobalds-square.htm>Theobalds Square</A>.

<H2>Admiral of the Fleet Sir Hedworth Meux <SMALL><SMALL><SPAN STYLE=font-weight:normal>(Not produced by Philippa Threlfall)</SPAN></SMALL></SMALL></H2>

<IMG SRC=plaques/meux.jpg STYLE=float:left;margin-right:8px>
<IMG SRC=portraits/meux.jpg STYLE=float:right;margin-left:8px>

The Meux family began renting Theobalds around 1820, and acquired it
shortly after. Hedworth inherited the grounds from Lady Valerie Meux under
the condition that he change his surname to match hers (his family surname
is Lambton). By 1919, Sir Hedworth Meux owned Theobalds and generously
donated most of its grounds by <A HREF=../covenant.htm>covenant</A>
to the people of Cheshunt, to be used as a public park called The Cedars.

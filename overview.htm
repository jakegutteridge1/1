<center><h1>Welcome to Cedars Park</h1></center>

<p>Cedars Park is a public park located in Cheshunt, Hertfordshire. Once the Royal Palace of Theobalds, which was regularly visited by Queen Elizabeth I and later became King James I's favourite residence, the grounds are of significant historical and national interest. After acquisition by the Meux brewing family, Admiral Sir Hedworth Meux signed a covenant in 1919 that bestowed the grounds as a public park for the people of Cheshunt to enjoy, which was officially opened on 2 July 1921. Over 100 years later, despite busy dual carriageways on two sides, the area survives as a tranquil space for relaxation and leisure.</p>

<p>The park is managed by Broxbourne Borough Council, with the Friends of Cedars Park volunteers providing assistance in maintenance and organising public events. The park has received a Green Flag Award every year since 2009.</p>

<center><h1>Welcome to Cedars Park</h1></center>

<p>Cedars Park is a public park located in Cheshunt, Hertfordshire. The attractive landscape includes a play maze, turf mound, duck pond, and a mature & diverse arboretum, and other features include a replica WWI tank, Tommy statue, sensory flowerbeds, historical murals, wooden carvings, and an animal centre.</p>

<p>Once the Royal Palace of Theobalds, which was regularly visited by Queen Elizabeth I and later became King James I's favourite residence, the grounds (approximately 19 acres in size) are of significant historical and national interest. The palace was largely destroyed during the English Civil War, as many of the rooves contained valuable lead, which was sold to support the troops. After acquisition by the Meux brewing family, Admiral Sir Hedworth Meux signed a covenant in 1919 that bestowed the grounds as a public park for the people of Cheshunt to enjoy, which was officially opened on 2 July 1921, named "The Cedars". Over 100 years later, despite busy dual carriageways on two sides, the area retains a tranquil atmosphere and period charm - many remains of Theobalds Palace and its subsequent structures can be found around the park.</p>

<p>The park is managed by Broxbourne Borough Council, with the Friends of Cedars Park volunteers providing assistance in maintenance and organising public events. The park has received a <a href="https://www.greenflagaward.org" target="_blank">Green Flag Award</a> every year since 2009.</p>

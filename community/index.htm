<h3>Share your memories of Cedars Park</h3>

<p>The park's <a href="https://cedarspark.proboards.com/board/3/remember" target="_blank">Community Forum</a> has hardly been used since its launch in 2019. We know that many visitors have memories and photos of Cedars Park from the distant past, therefore it would be great to share these with the community, not just for happy memories but also to show younger people what the park used to look like.</p>

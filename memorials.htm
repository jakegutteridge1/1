A list of these memorials has been compiled by Tarant Hobbs and Jake Gutteridge. Information is wanted for those whose names are not listed, i.e. blank sections and when there is only a memorial number and no name. If you are a relative of a person remembered in Cedars Park whose name is not listed here, please contact us by e-mailing <a href="mailto:jakant@mail.com">jakant@mail.com</a>. This will help in creating a comprehensive list of the personal memorials.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://bit.ly/3i4bamV" target="_blank">View list</a></p><p style="text-align: center;"><br />There is also a Google Map of these memorials, showing photos and their locations in the Park, which is currently being produced as a community project.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://bit.ly/3uBJjNN" target="_blank">View map</a></p></body></html>

In 1765, George Prescott began building five large houses, known as <a href="theobalds-square.htm">Theobalds Square</a>. These were completed in 1770. As a focal point, he had an arch built with pleasing patterns, complete with two huts. Ruins on either side of the arch may have been another two huts. The arch is made of brick on the South side, and a mixture of rough flint and other materials on the other - some suggest that these include puddingstone and tufa. A 'T' shaped pond was situated in front of the Flint Arch, creating a pleasing reflection in the view from The Cedars.
<p>
Several niches can be found at the top of the arch. These may have been included purely for aesthetic purposes, or they could have been used to hold candles to illuminate the arch at night. Another possible use is as pigeon holes - pigeon pie was a very popular dish at Georgian palaces.
<p>
The two huts are made of brick on the inside, which has been plastered, and an outer layer of flint and other materials (like the arch). For a long time, people were free to enter them and children enjoyed playing inside, but today they are protected by a metal fence to ensure their long-term preservation.
<p>
According to the council's information boards, the huts were used to take shade during the summer months. While this is possible, it could be argued that the structures would have been quite cramped to sit in, even at that time, and there does not appear to be any historical evidence behind this claim, therefore it could simply be an erroneous assumption.
<p>
It is much more likely that the huts served as ice houses, for perishable foods to be refrigerated throughout the year using ice extracted from frozen ponds in the winter. They have a strong resemblance to other ice houses, despite having what appear to be holes for windows, which were uncommon but found on some.

<i>The Lodge had been built in the 1760's and large country houses of the time nearly always had an ice house to store ice collected in winter for use over the summer months</i>

<blockquote>
<i>From the 17th century, the rich and privileged increasingly built ice houses in the grounds of their large houses in the country and sometimes actually within town houses to preserve food and to provide ice for the table and especially to cool wine. It is estimated that some 3,000 were built in Britain, the majority during the period 1750 – 1875.</i>

As part of the Cedars Park heritage project in the 2010s, English Heritage supplied £90K for a professional restoration of the Flint Arch.

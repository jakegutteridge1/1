<h1>Cedars Park Archaeological Report</h1>
</center>

<p>In preparation for a Conservation Management Plan to support a Green Flag Award application, Broxbourne Borough Council commissioned an Archaeological Investigation which was undertaken by Oxford Archaeology in 2007 and published in 2008. This comprehensive document details the buildings and gardens comprising Theobalds Palace, and what remains today.</p>

<p>The publication consists of a <a href="https://eprints.oxfordarchaeology.com/1679/7/BROXCP%2007%20Cheshunt%2C%20Broxbourne%2C%20Cedars%20Park_A1b.pdf" target="_blank">document of proposal</a> and a later-published <a href="https://eprints.oxfordarchaeology.com/77/1/BROXCP07.pdf">Report</a> of the investigations.</a></p>

<h3>Brief Summary</h3>

<p>The grounds that Cedars Park stands on have a very rich and important history. Dating back to the 14th century, the grounds once held the Manor of Cullynges, which was sold and renamed several times, before the name Theobalds was established, and upon Sir William Cecil's acquisition of the estate, he expanded it with a small mansion for his son. While Theobalds was originally bought as a private family home, it was further expanded, quite heavily, after Queen Elizabeth I's first visit to better suit her requirements and desires.</p>

<p>Sir Robert Cecil inherited the estate after his father died in 1598. Elizabeth stayed at the Palace at least 15 times before her death in 1603, and shortly after, King James I visited with Scottish nobility, in 1607 acquiring it by exchanging Hatfield House with Cecil. It quickly became the King's favourite property. He expanded it with a deer hunting park, a silkworm house, re-building of existing structures, and a surrounding wall. The Palace accommodated many important figures, and James spent much of his later life here before his death on the grounds.</p>

<p>In a parliamentary survey from 1650, Theobalds is estimated to be 2500+ acres in size, and is described as being in excellent condition and not fit for demolition. The report was misread, which culminated in a significant portion of the Palace being destroyed. The property was also damaged in the Civil War, during which time Major-General William Packer stripped the lead from the roofs of the palace buildings to pay the troops.</p>

<p>Kings Charles II, Charles II and William III acquired the palace after their respective thronal parents died. Hans William Bentick had the property, then his son, before the Prescott family took over and expanded it with four houses and a flint folly.</p>

<p>It was then sold to the Meux family, and in 1919, Admiral of the Fleet Sir Hedworth Meux signed a <a href="covenant.htm">covenant</a>, bestowing the grounds to the people of Cheshunt as a public park called The Cedars, which opened on 2 July 1921.</p>

<H1>History of Cedars Park</H1>
</CENTER>

<HR>

Cedars Park has a very rich history as the former site of
Theobalds Palace, a stately home and grand palace.

<P>In years past, Theobalds - pronounced "Tibbles" at that time -
accommodated many important people, including Earls, Dukes, a
Chancellor of the Exchequer, and European nobility. The house's most
notable residents are Queen Elizabeth I, who stayed there on
at least fifteen occasions under the care of Sirs William and
Robert Cecil in the 16th century, and King James I, who exchanged
Hatfield House with Sir Robert Cecil in 1607 and heavily expanded
Theobalds' buildings and gardens to create a palace.

<blockquote><i>There came before him some of the nobility, some barons, knights, esquires, gentlemen and others. Among them were the Sherrill of Essex and most of his men, the trumpets sounding next before his Highness...his Majesty not riding continuously betwixt the same two noblemen, but sometimes with one and sometimes with another as seemed best to his Highness; the whole nobility of the land around him observing no place of nobility, but all bare headed; all of whom alighted at the first courts door, save only his Majesty who rode along still, with four noblemen laying hands upon his steed. In this manner he came to the court's door where I myself stood, where he alighted, from his horse, from which he had not gone ten princely paces when there was delivered to him a petition by a young gentleman, his Majesty returning his gracious answer that he should be heard and have justice. At the entrance to that court stood several noblemen among whom was Robert Cecil, who, there meeting his Majesty, conducted him into his house - all which was practiced with so great applause of the people as could be - hearty prayers and throwing up of hats.</i></blockquote>

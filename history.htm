<H1>History of Cedars Park</H1>
<H3>and the former Theobalds Palace</H3>
</CENTER>

<HR />

<P>Cedars Park is incredibly important as the former grounds of
the grand estate of Theobalds, which was used on occasion by
Queen Elizabeth I, then by James I on his travels to London. The
King loved it so much that he gave up Hatfield House so that he
could live here. England was run right from these grounds for
much of the Jacobean period, since the country was an absolute
monarchy at the time. From what we know, Theobalds in its heyday
could easily have been the most elaborate and renowned estate
in the country.

<P>The palace was largely destroyed during the English Civil War,
as many of the rooves contained valuable lead, which was sold to
support the troops. After acquisition by the Meux brewing family,
Admiral Sir Hedworth Meux signed a  <A HREF=covenant/index.htm>covenant</A>
in 1919 that bestowed the grounds as a public park for the people of
Cheshunt to enjoy, which was officially opened on 2 July 1921,
named "The Cedars".

<BLOCKQUOTE><I>
There came before him some of the nobility, some barons, knights,
esquires, gentlemen and others. Among them were the Sherrill of Essex
and most of his men, the trumpets sounding next before his Highness...
his Majesty not riding continuously betwixt the same two noblemen,
but sometimes with one and sometimes with another as seemed best to
his Highness; the whole nobility of the land around him observing no
place of nobility, but all bare headed; all of whom alighted at the
first courts door, save only his Majesty who rode along still, with
four noblemen laying hands upon his steed.
<P>In this manner he came to the court's door where I myself stood,
where he alighted, from his horse, from which he had not gone ten
princely paces when there was delivered to him a petition by a young
gentleman, his Majesty returning his gracious answer that he should
be heard and have justice. At the entrance to that court stood several
noblemen among whom was Robert Cecil, who, there meeting his Majesty,
conducted him into his house - all which was practiced with so great
applause of the people as could be - hearty prayers and throwing up of hats.

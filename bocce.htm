<H1>Bocce at Cedars Park</H1>
</CENTER>

Bocce ("bocheh") is an ancient Italian bowling game. A bocce
court was added to Cedars Park in 2011 and has since been used very
frequently by the local Italian community.

<P>Playing bocce is a great way for anyone to relax, and is suited
to all ages. Even if you are in a wheelchair, bocce is quite easy
to play - professionally, bocce for disabled people is known as
'boccia', however it is virtually the same as standard bocce.
Why not buy a set and start playing in the park?

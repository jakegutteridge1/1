<h1>Bocce rules for casual games</h1>
I am not a professional Bocce player. This guide is for casual games only, and may not reflect traditional Italian rules.

<h2>Preparations</h2>

<h4>Balls</h4>

<p>Bocce sets have eight bocces and one pallino. The pallino (also known as jack) is a small ball used as a target, and is thrown at the start of each game and then continually as you bowl all of your balls on each side of the court. This guide will be focusing on eight-bocce sets, as other sets are made for Petanque, Lawn Bowls or some other Boules game, even if they are labelled 'Bocce' (there are several incorrectly labelled sets being sold on eBay). We recommend metal ones as they provide excellent weighting.</p>

<p>Our local Sicilian group uses a different type - larger balls with a rough outer coating - which we could not find on the Web. Most Bocce balls are metal inside. Wooden balls are also available, although these seem like they would be prone to cracking after prolonged use. Cheap multi-coloured Bocce sets are fine for casual games (they are the recommended type if children are playing) however they are much lighter than metal sets due to being weighted by water, and are therefore more difficult to bowl accurately.</p>

<p>If you do not have a pallino, a golf ball can be used as an alternative.</p>

<h4>Court</h4>

<p>Bocce is best played on a hard, sandy surface, free of bumps or indents in the ground - if you have a local Bocce court, this will be much better than grass or an asphalt or concrete path - the surface should be smooth and hard. Having said that, casual games of Bocce can easily be played on a grass field if you do not have easy access to a purpose-built court, although you may have to throw harder.</p>

<h4>Players</h4>

<p>Most Bocce sets have four different patterns, therefore they can either be played in a group of 4, or 2 with two patterns each. Depending on the set, 8 may be able to play. You could also combine two or more sets to accommodate more players.</p>

<h4>Scoring</h4>

<p>Ensure there is a person taking note of the score. This is best done by tally on a notepad, or, if your court has one, a dedicated scoreboard. A target number should be set, so that the one who scores that many points first wins the game. If this is not done, there is no way to tell when the game should end!</p>

<h2>Game</h2>

<p>The purpose of Bocce is to get your balls as close to the pallino as possible.</p>

<ul>
<li>Any player throws the pallino - try to get it as close to the end as possible, without touching the court wall. All balls can touch the sides of the court, but not the ends.</li>
<li>Next, the same person who just bowled the pallino bowls a bocce ball. All other players then also individually bowl one of their own. Repeat until no-one is left with any balls.</li>
<li>See which of the balls is the closest. This is almost always easy to do by eye. Score one point to the person who bowled the ball that is closest to the pallino. If the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, etc. closest belong the same person as the closest ball, score an additional point for each one.</li>
<li>Move/bowl the balls to the opposite end of the court and repeat all aforementioned steps until the target score has been reached.</li>
<li>Players can bounce their balls off the sides of the court.</li>
<li>If a bocce ball touches the end of the court, the player who bowled it should not bowl any more until at the other end. However, depending on how formal you want the game to be, this does not necessarily have to be followed.</li>
</ul>

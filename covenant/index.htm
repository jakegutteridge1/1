<h1>Cedars Park Covenant</h1>

<p>This document was written by Admiral of the Fleet Sir Hedworth Meux in 1919. He inherited Theobalds and donated a portion of the grounds to be opened as a public park for the people of Cheshunt. It also outlines how he intended the park to be managed and used.

<p>Two versions of the covenant are available - a scan of the <a href="original.pdf">original papers</a> from HM Land Registry, or a <a href="typed.pdf">typed copy</a> which is clearer to read - both contain the same content.

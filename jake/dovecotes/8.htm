<p>Turkey's first pigeon holes are believed to have been created in the 16th century, although most were built in the 18th and 19th. They are carved into rocks and buildings, often close to bodies of water, since pigeons require frequent rehydration throughout the day.</p>

<p>Large caves carved into rocks were accessed by a downward tunnel from the top of the cliff, or a passage from the bottom with a ladder. In some areas, the rock around the holes was painted white, as it is believed that pigeons are attracted to this colour.</p>

<p>Flowers, leaves and soil were used to make paints that would be used for decorating the dovecotes with Old Turkish sayings and drawings of animals, plants and the Sun. Sometimes, a mixture of plaster and egg white would be brushed onto the surface of the rock, which would make it slippery and hard for predators to climb.</p>

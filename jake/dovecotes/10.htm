<p>Dovecotes in the US are largely limited to states which were colonised by the French, most notably Louisiana. Under French rule, several dovecotes were constructed, and they took the French name 'pigeonniers'. This name has retained its use by Louisianians, although now spelled 'pigeonaires'.</p>

<p>Built on Creole plantation estates in the 18th and 19th centuries, they were used as status symbols. It is common for these dovecotes to have two stories - the top is reserved for the pigeons while the bottom is used for another purpose of the owner's choice - popular functions included a storage room, office, or <i>garconnier</i> (men's guest bedroom).</p>

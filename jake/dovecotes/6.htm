<p>Although found in other parts of the country, many of Greece's pigeon houses (called Peristeriones) are located on the Cyclades, mostly Tinos. Tinos is believed to be the area of the world most densely populated with them, with more than 1000 over an area of 194.5 sq km.</p>

<p>Built in the 18th and 19th centuries, these buildings show off beautiful patterns and shapes made of wood, built into their walls. These can include trees, animals, flowers, people and the owner's initials. Several of these buildings also have diamond and triangle patterns, as shown in the photograph above.</p>

<p>Tombs dating back to 1600BC were excavated in southern Greece. They contain ornaments depicting doves - one shows a goddess holding a dove in either hand, with one on her head, and the other an altar on which doves are sitting. </p>

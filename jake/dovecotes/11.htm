<center><h2>Dovecotes Today</h2></center>

<hr />

<p>In today's world, dovecotes are mostly obsolete (with the exception of Egypt and possibly some other places) due to the decline of pigeon fertiliser and the increase in poultry and egg availability. This has resulted in many old buildings being abandoned. However, many have also been converted for another purpose, such as this tea room in Varzaneh, Iran.</p>

<p>Most Scottish pigeon houses are made of stone and they are known as 'doocots'. A 'beehive' shape is common (see picture to right), as well as towers and flat-sided houses with slanted roofs, called 'lectern' doocots.</p>

<p>Many doocots, especially those in churchyards and religious areas, have crosses, either carved into the building or, as is the case in the photo below, in the form of a window arrangement. Some had two doors for extra protection of the contents. This was done because poverty was rife in 18th century Scotland, and food was more valued than it is today.</p>

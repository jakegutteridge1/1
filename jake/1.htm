<p>A dovecote is a building in which pigeons nest. They are primarily used for harvesting the pigeons' meat, droppings and/or eggs. Their feathers were also used for pillow stuffing, as there is a myth that those who sleep on pigeon feathers will live a long life. The buildings are believed to have originated in Egypt and the Middle East around 2000BC, gaining popularity in the Medieval period.</p>

<p>Dovecotes contain pigeon holes, small niches in walls for pigeons to make their nest. These are often square in shape, but more elaborate designs can be found. Rarely, pigeon holes are built for aesthetic reasons rather than for farming.</p>

<p>In almost every country that uses pigeon houses, the birds' meat, eggs and droppings are harvested. Their droppings make an excellent fertiliser, due to their nitrogen content. They were also used as an ingredient in gunpowder (as it contains saltpetre) as well as a leather softener and cloth dye. Some countries used pigeons for medicinal purposes, as it was believed that they could heal a wide range of illnesses.</p>
